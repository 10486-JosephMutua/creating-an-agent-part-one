What Is a TIP?
Treatment Improvement Protocols (TIPs), developed by the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), part of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), are best-practice guidelines for the treatment of substance use disorders. CSAT draws on the experience and knowledge of clinical, research, and administrative experts to produce the TIPs, which are distributed to facilities and individuals across the country. The audience for the TIPs is expanding beyond public and private treatment facilities to include practitioners in mental health, criminal justice, primary care, and other health care and social service settings.
CSATís Knowledge Application Program (KAP) expert panel, a distinguished group of experts on substance use disorders and professionals in such related fields as primary care, mental health, and social services, works with the State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors to generate topics for the TIPs. Topics are based on the fieldís current needs for information and guidance.
After selecting a topic, CSAT invites staff from pertinent Federal agencies and national organizations to be members of a resource panel that recommends specific areas of focus as well as resources that should be considered in developing the content for the TIP. These recommendations are communicated to a consensus panel composed of experts on the topic who have been nominated by their peers. This consensus panel participates in a series of discussions. The information and recommendations on which they reach consensus form the foundation of the TIP. The members of each consensus panel represent substance abuse treatment programs, hospitals, community health centers, counseling programs, criminal justice and child welfare agencies, and private practitioners. A panel chair (or co-chairs) ensures that the contents of the TIP mirror the results of the groupís collaboration.
A large and diverse group of experts closely reviews the draft document. Once the changes recommended by these field reviewers have been incorporated, the TIP is prepared for publication, in print and on line. TIPs can be accessed via the Internet at www.kap.samhsa.gov. The 

online TIPs are consistently updated and provide the field with state-of-the-art information.
Although each TIP strives to include an evidence base for the practices it recommends, CSAT recognizes that the field of substance abuse treatment is evolving, and research frequently lags behind the innovations pioneered in the field. A major goal of each TIP is to convey ìfront-lineî information quickly but responsibly. For this reason, recommendations proffered in the TIP are attributed to either panelistsí clinical experience or the literature. If research supports a particular approach, citations are provided.
This TIP, Medication-Assisted Treatment for
Opioid Addiction in Opioid Treatment Programs, incorporates the many changes in medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction (MAT) that have occurred over the most active decade of change since the inception of this treatment modality approximately 40 years ago. The TIP describes the nature and dimensions of opioid use disorders and their treatment in the United States, including basic principles of MAT and historical and regulatory developments. It presents consensus panel recommendations and evidence-based best practices for treatment of opioid addiction in opioid treatment programs (OTPs). It also examines related medical, psychiatric, sociological, and substance use disorders and their treatment as part of a comprehensive maintenance treatment program. The TIP includes a discussion of the ethical considerations that arise in most OTPs, and it provides a useful summary of areas for emphasis in successfully administering MAT in OTPs.

Forew ord
The Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) series supports SAMHSAís mission of building resilience and facilitating recovery for people with or at risk for mental or substance use disorders by providing best-practices guidance to clinicians, program administrators, and payers to improve the quality and effectiveness of service delivery and thereby promote recovery. TIPs are the result of careful consideration of all relevant clinical and health services research findings, demonstration experience, and implementation requirements. A panel of non-Federal clinical researchers, clinicians, program administrators, and client advocates debates and discusses its particular areas of expertise until it reaches a consensus on best practices. This panelís work is then reviewed and critiqued by field reviewers.
The talent, dedication, and hard work that TIPs panelists and reviewers bring to this highly participatory process have helped bridge the gap between the promise of research and the needs of practicing clinicians and administrators who serve, in the most current and effective ways, people who abuse substances. We are grateful to all who have joined with us to contribute to advances in the substance abuse treatment field.

Executive Sum m ary
Research supports the perspective that opioid addiction is a medical disorder that can be treated effectively with medications when they are administered under conditions consistent with their pharmacological efficacy and when treatment includes necessary supportive services such as psychosocial counseling, treatment for co-occurring disorders, medical services, and vocational rehabilitation. Medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction (MAT) has been effective in facilitating recovery from opioid addiction for many patients.
This TIP provides a detailed description of MAT, especially in opioid treatment programs (OTPs). MAT includes optional approaches such as comprehensive maintenance treatment, medical maintenance treatment, detoxification, and medically supervised withdrawal. Some or all of these approaches can be provided in OTPs or other settings. With the approval of buprenorphine for physicianís office-based opioid treatment, MAT availability is expected to increase.
Growing understanding and acceptance of opioid addiction as a treatable medical disorder have facilitated advances in MAT. The effectiveness of MAT advanced significantly with the development of methadone maintenance treatment in the 1960s and the creation and expansion of publicly funded treatment programs in the 1970s. The first official Federal use of the term ìmaintenance treatmentî (referring to opioid addiction treatment) occurred in the Narcotic Addict Treatment Act of 1974. Perhaps the most important development in MAT during the 1990s was publication of recommendations by a National Institutes of Health consensus panel on Effective Medical Treatment of Opiate Addiction. The panel concluded that opioid addiction is a treatable medical disorder and explicitly rejected notions that addiction is self-induced or a failure of willpower. The panel called for a commitment to providing effective treatment for opioid addiction and for Federal and State efforts to reduce the stigma attached to MAT and to expand MAT through increased funding and less restrictive regulation. The implementation of an accreditation system for OTPs further serves to standardize and improve MAT.

Accompanying these improvements in opioid addiction treatment is an increasing emphasis on the concomitant treatment of diseases such as HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, and tuberculosis, all of which occur at higher rates among people who inject drugs than in the general population. 
This TIP addresses a variety of issues and challenges in MAT, including
ï Drug testing for screening and assessmentó how and when (chapters 4 and 9)
ï Administrative dischargeóissues of safety and noncompliance (chapter 8)
ï Use of other substances with opioids and resulting complications for MAT (chapter 11)
ï Co-occurring mental disorders and their complications for MAT (chapter 12)
ï Administration of staffs and procedures (chapter 14).
The following paragraphs summarize chapters in this TIP.
Chapter 1, Introduction, introduces MAT and provides important concepts for understanding this TIP. It describes opioid addiction as a medical disorder with similarities to other disorders. It outlines the main options for MAT, such as choices of medication and optional services. The chapter concludes by summarizing the greatest challenges facing OTPs and offering a vision of the future.
Chapter 2, History of Medication-Assisted Treatment for Opioid Addiction, provides the historical context for MAT. It details the history of the use of opioids in the United States; the political, legal, and regulatory responses to opioid abuse; treatment trends (including logistics and strategies); and development of modern medications available in MAT.
Chapter 3, Pharmacology of Medications Used To Treat Opioid Addiction, reviews the pharmacology and clinical applications of the medications used for treating opioid addiction. It focuses on the metabolic activity, dosage forms, efficacy, side effects, drug interactions, safety considerations, and current availability and restrictions for methadone, levo-alpha acetyl methadol (LAAM), buprenorphine, and naltrexone. The information will enable treatment providers to compare the benefits and limitations of available opioid addiction treatment medications.
Chapter 4, Initial Screening, Admission Procedures, and Assessment Techniques, describes screening and assessment procedures used with applicants for admission to treatment and with patients in MAT. The chapter describes components of the screening (or intake) process that provides a foundation for treatment and procedures used during the admissions process to ensure thorough, efficient data collection and to gather information for ongoing treatment intervention. Components of substance use, medical, medication induction, and comprehensive psychosocial assessments are used to determine MAT eligibility, individualize treatment plans, and monitor changes in patient status. The chapter also provides information on managing emergency situations during admission and treatment.
Chapter 5, Clinical Pharmacotherapy, explains opioid pharmacotherapy, focusing on the clinical use of methadone, buprenorphine, LAAM, and naltrexone. It details the discrete stages of opioid pharmacotherapy, each of which requires unique clinical considerations. It discusses factors that may affect individual responses to treatment medications and key considerations in determining individual dosages. For patients who must leave MAT, either voluntarily or involuntarily, the chapter explains methods of withdrawal from treatment medications. It also discusses important considerations in administering take-home medication.

Chapter 6, PatientñTreatment Matching: Types of Services and Levels of Care, describes a multidimensional, clinically driven strategy for matching patients in MAT with the types of treatment services and levels of care that optimize treatment outcomes, within or in conjunction with OTPs. Patientñtreatment matching involves individualizing the choice and application of treatment resources to each patientís needs, abilities, and preferences. The chapter describes alternative types of treatment programs and settings for identified types of patients and recommends elements that should be included in patientñtreatment matching, including ways to accommodate patients with special needs. The chapter describes elements of a treatment plan and the planning process, including the roles of counselor and patient, the importance of cultural and linguistic competence, motivation for treatment, and the need for a multidisciplinary team.
Chapter 7, Phases of Treatment, describes phases of treatment for patients in MAT. These phases are conceptualized as parts of a dynamic continuum of patient progress toward intended treatment outcomes. Each patient progresses according to his or her capacity and needs. After an orientation to introduce patients to the program, successive treatment phases include (1) the acute phase, during which patients attempt to eliminate illicit-opioid use and lessen the intensity of other problems associated with their addiction, (2) the rehabilitative phase, during which patients continue to address addiction while gaining control of other major life domains, (3) the supportive-care phase, during which patients maintain their abstinence while receiving other interventions when needed, (4) the medical-maintenance phase, during which patients are committed to continuing pharmacotherapy for the foreseeable future but no longer rely on other OTP services, (5) the tapering and readjustment phase, an optional phase in which patients gradually reduce and eliminate opioid treatment medication, and (6) the continuing-care phase, in which patients who have tapered from treatment medication continue regular contact with their treatment program. Phases of treatment address the therapeutic relationship, motivation,  patientsí use of alcohol and illicit drugs, their mental and medical disorders, legal problems, and basic needs (including housing, education, and vocational training).

Most patients need more frequent, intensive services in the acute phase, careful monitoring and diversified services during rehabilitative and supportive-care phases, and less frequent services in subsequent phases.
Chapter 8, Approaches to Providing
Comprehensive Care and Maximizing Patient Retention, describes the core- and extendedcare services essential to MAT effectiveness in OTPs. It explains how a comprehensive treatment program improves patient retention in treatment and the likelihood of positive treatment outcomes. Patients who receive regular, frequent, integrated psychosocial and medical services along with opioid pharmacotherapy often realize better outcomes than those who receive only limited services. Counseling services are integral to comprehensive maintenance treatment and can be behavioral, psychotherapeutic, or family oriented. Strategies that target relapse prevention also should be part of any comprehensive treatment program. The chapter describes ways to increase patient retention and avoid administrative discharge. Administrative discharge usually results in rapid relapse and may lead to incarceration or death. Clear communication and awareness on the part of both patients and staff members help avoid administrative discharge.
Chapter 9, Drug Testing as a Tool, presents an overview of drug testing in OTPs. Drug testing provides an objective measure of treatment efficacy and a tool to monitor patient progress, as well as information for quality assurance, program planning, and accreditation. OTPs must ensure the clinical utility of test results and protect patientsí privacy. Several drugtesting methodologies are available or in development, including tests of urine, oral fluid, blood, sweat, and hair. The chapter describes the benefits and limitations of these tests. Most often, OTPs use urine drug testing by immunoassay or thin-layer chromatography because these methods are the least costly and best validated of all options, but the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment has indicated that oral-fluid testing may be an alternative approach in OTPs. The chapter describes criteria that an OTP should use to collect specimens and how treatment providers should respond to test results that indicate possible treatment problems.
Chapter 10, Associated Medical Problems in Patients Who Are Opioid Addicted, focuses on diagnosis and treatment of the medical conditions most commonly seen in MAT patients. A primary issue in MAT is deciding which medical services patients should receive in house versus through referral to outside providers. Chapter 10 examines the factors that influence this determination and reviews the screening services and protocols OTPs should have in place to evaluate patientsí acute and chronic medical problems and to perform periodic reassessments.
Chapter 11, Treatment of Multiple Substance Use, discusses problems associated with patientsí continued abuse of other substances, which is likely to affect patientsí participation in MAT, proper use of medication, and mental and physical health. Some substances, such as alcohol and certain sedatives, have a potentially lethal effect when combined with an opioid agonist or partial agonist medication. A number of interventions can address the continued abuse of other substances, including increased drug testing and the use of disulfiram, contingency management, dose adjustments, and counseling.
Chapter 12, Treatment of Co-Occurring Disorders, addresses issues for patients who have substance use and co-occurring mental disorders. These patients often exhibit behaviors or experience emotions that interfere with treatment and require special interventions. The chapter describes the prevalence of co-occurring disorders, screening and diagnosis of these disorders, and the effects of such disorders on treatment outcomes. It discusses general issues, specific psychiatric diagnoses, and a range of interventions (including psychoeducation, psychotherapy, and pharmacotherapy) to treat co-occurring disorders. The chapter explores special issues such as acute psychiatric danger, how to handle emergencies, and the effect of co-occurring disorders on behaviors that increase the risk of infectious diseases.
Chapter 13, Medication-Assisted Treatment for Opioid Addiction During Pregnancy, describes the complications associated with pregnancy and opioid addiction and how pregnancy should be addressed during MAT to reduce the potential for harm to a pregnant woman in MAT and her fetus. Among the main concerns are those related to HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C. The chapter describes how to adjust methadone dosage and manage overdose and withdrawal and addresses the postpartum treatment of mother and child, including topics such as breast-feeding and neonatal abstinence syndrome. The chapter focuses on methadone, which has been accepted for treating opioid addiction during pregnancy since the late 1970s.
Chapter 14, Administrative Considerations, covers the challenging administrative aspects of managing and staffing the complex and dynamic environment of an OTP. Successful treatment outcomes depend on the competence, values, and attitudes of staff members. To develop and retain a stable team of treatment personnel, program administrators must recruit and hire qualified, capable, culturally sensitive individuals; offer competitive salaries and benefit packages; and provide good supervision and ongoing training. Implementing community relations and community education efforts is important for OTPs. Outreach and educational efforts can dispel misconceptions about MAT and people in recovery. Finally, the chapter provides a framework for gathering and analyzing program performance data. Program evaluation contributes to improved treatment services by enabling administrators to base changes in services on evidence of what works. Evaluation also serves as a way to educate and influence policymakers and public and private payers.
Appendix D, Ethical Considerations in MAT, explores ethical issues inherent in MAT and provides a structure that administrators and clinicians can use in considering how to resolve them.

Challenges
The Future of MAT
Opioid addiction is a problem with high costs to individuals, families, and society. Injection drug use-associated exposure accounts for approximately one-third of all AIDS cases diagnosed in the United States through 2003 (National Center for HIV, STD and TB Prevention 2005) and for many cases of hepatitis C (National Institute on Drug Abuse 2000; Thomas 2001). In the criminal justice system, people who use heroin account for an estimated one-third of the $17 billion spent each year for legal responses to drug-related crime. Indirect costs from lost productivity and overdose also are high (Mark et al. 2001), and people with opioid addictions and their families experience severe reductions in their quality of life. The increasing abuse of prescription opioids is another major concern, both for their damaging effects and as gateway drugs to other substance use (see chapter 2).
Purpose of This TIP
This Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) is a guide to medicationassisted treatment for opioid addiction (MAT) in opioid treatment programs (OTPs). Compared with MAT in other settings, such as physiciansí offices or detoxification centers, treatment in OTPs provides a more comprehensive, individually tailored program of medication therapy integrated with psychosocial and medical treatment and support services that address most factors affecting each patient. Treatment in OTPs also can include detoxification from illicit opioids and medically supervised withdrawal from maintenance medications.
This TIP combines and updates TIP 1 (State Methadone Treatment
Guidelines, published in 1993), TIP 10 (Assessment and Treatment of Cocaine-Abusing Methadone-Maintained Patients, published in 1994),
TIP 20 (Matching Treatment to Patient Needs in Opioid Substitution
Therapy, published in 1995), and TIP 22 (LAAM in the Treatment of Opiate Addiction, published in 1995). It incorporates the many changes in MAT that have occurred since the publication of TIP 1, primarily as they are reflected in OTPs, and discusses the challenges that remain.

K ey Definitions
The glossary (Appendix C) and list of acronyms (Appendix B) at the back of the book provide definitions of key words, terms, acronyms, and abbreviations. Particularly important distinctions among selected terms and phrases are discussed below.
Distinctions between dependence and addiction vary across treatment fields. This TIP uses the term ìdependenceî to refer to physiological effects of substance abuse and ìaddictionî for physical dependence on and subjective need and craving for a psychoactive substance either to experience its positive effects or to avoid negative effects associated with withdrawal from that substance.
The intended audience for this
TIP is treatment providers and
administrators working in OTPs.
MAT is any treatment for opioid addiction that includes a medication (e.g., methadone, buprenorphine, levo-alpha acetyl methadol [LAAM], naltrexone) approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for opioid addiction detoxification or maintenance treatment. MAT may be provided in
an OTP or an OTP medication unit (e.g., pharmacy, physicianís office) or, for buprenorphine, a physicianís office or other health care setting. Comprehensive maintenance, medical maintenance, interim maintenance, detoxification, and medically supervised withdrawal (defined under ìTreatment Optionsî below and individually in the glossary) are types of MAT.
An OTP is any treatment program certified by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in conformance with 42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 8, to provide supervised assessment and medication-assisted treatment for patients who are opioid addicted. An OTP can exist in a number of settings, including, but not limited to, intensive outpatient, residential, and hospital settings. Types of treatment can include medical maintenance, medically supervised withdrawal, and detoxification, either with or without various levels of medical, psychosocial, and other types of care.
The term ìabstinenceî in this TIP refers to nonuse of alcohol or illicit drugs (drugs not approved by FDA), as well as nonabuse of prescription drugs. Abstinence does not refer to withdrawal from legally prescribed maintenance medications for addiction treatment (for which ìmedically supervised withdrawalî is the preferred term).
Terminology continues to evolve for describing the combination of substance use and mental disorders. In this TIP, ìco-occurringî is the preferred term, but others use ìcoexisting,î ìdual diagnosis,î and ìcomorbidî to describe the combination of current or former substance use disorders and any other Axis I or any Axis II mental disorders recognized by the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision
(American Psychiatric Association 2000). (See also TIP 42, Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons With Co-Occurring Disorders [CSAT 2005b].)
A udience for This TIP
The intended audience for this TIP is treatment providers and administrators working in OTPs. Other groups that want to understand the principles and procedures followed in MAT also will benefit.
A Decade of Chang e
Several forces are transforming the MAT field.
The implementation of an accreditation system (Federal Register 64:39814) is standardizing and improving opioid addiction treatment (for details, see 42 CFR, Part 8). Choices of medication, including methadone, buprenorphine, LAAM, and naltrexone (see chapter 3), now are available to treat opioid addiction. Each has its own benefits and limitations. Continued research on opioid addiction and treatment is clarifying what works to improve treatment outcomes, with an emphasis on accelerating the incorporation of evidence-based methods into treatment. Changes in the health care system nationwide (e.g., the growth of managed care and effects of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) are having an effect on OTPs and other types of health care programs. Understanding and acceptance of opioid addiction as a medical disorder by patients, health care providers, the media, and the public have increased since the publication of TIP 1.
MATó A M o re Accepted Form of Treatm ent Opioid addiction as a medical disorder
Discussions about whether addiction is a medical disorder or a moral problem have a long history. For decades, studies have supported the view that opioid addiction is a medical disorder that can be treated effectively with medications administered under conditions consistent with their pharmacological efficacy, when treatment includes comprehensive services, such as psychosocial counseling, treatment for co-occurring disorders, medical services, vocational rehabilitation services, and case management services (e.g., Dole and Nyswander 1967; McLellan et al. 1993). 
Dole (1988, p. 3025) described the medical basis of methadone maintenance as follows:
The treatment is corrective, normalizing neurological and endocrinologic processes in patients whose endogenous ligand-receptor function has been deranged by long-term use of powerful narcotic drugs. Why some persons who are exposed to narcotics are more susceptible than others to this derangement and whether long-term addicts can recover normal function without maintenance therapy are questions for the future. At present, the most that can be said is that there seems to be a specific neurological basis for the compulsive use of heroin by addicts and that methadone taken in optimal doses can correct the disorder.
Similarities to other medical disorders
McLellan and colleagues (2000) compared basic aspects of substance addiction with those of three disordersóasthma, hypertension, and diabetesówhich universally are considered ìmedicalî and usually chronic and relapsing and for which behavioral change is an important part of treatment. They found that genetic, personal-choice, and environmental factors played comparable roles in the etiology and course for these disorders and that rates of relapse and adherence to medication were similar, although substance addiction often was treated as an acute, not chronic, illness. Their review of outcome literature showed that, as with the other disorders, substance addiction has no reliable cure but that patients who comply with treatment regimens have more favorable outcomes. Fewer than 30 percent of patients with asthma, hypertension, or diabetes adhered to their medication regimens, prescribed diets, or other changes to increase their functional status and reduce their risk of symptom recurrence. As a result, 50 to 70 percent experienced recurrent symptoms each year to the point of requiring additional medical care to reestablish remission.
Another similarity found between opioid addiction and these medical disorders was their outcome predictors (McLellan et al. 2000). For example, patients who were older and employed with stable families and marriages were found to be more likely to comply with treatment and have positive treatment results than were younger, unemployed patients with less stable family support.
The concept of opioid addiction as a medical disorder was supported further by other treatment followup studies showing that opioid addiction has a reasonably predictable course, similar to such conditions as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma. For example, Woody and Cacciola (1994) found that the risk of relapse for a person who was opioid addicted was highest during the first 3 to 6 months after cessation of opioid use. This risk declined for the first 12 months after cessation and continued to decrease but at a much slower rate. Results from other posttreatment studies indicated that roughly 80 percent of patients who are opioid addicted but leave MAT resume daily opioid use within 1 year after leaving treatment (e.g., Magura and Rosenblum 2001).
Similar to patients with other chronic disorders, many who are opioid addicted have been found to respond best to treatment that combines pharmacological and behavioral interventions. As detailed throughout this TIP, treatment of opioid addiction with maintenance medication, along with other treatment services for related problems that affect patientsí motivation and treatment compliance, increases the likelihood of cessation of opioid abuse. Conversely, discontinuation of maintenance medication often results in dropout from other services and a return to previous levels of opioid abuse, with its accompanying adverse medical and psychosocial consequences (Ball and Ross 1991). Entry into comprehensive maintenance treatment provides an opportunity to prevent, screen for, and treat diseases such as HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and C, and tuberculosis (see chapter 10) and to increase compliance with medical, psychiatric, and prenatal care (Chaulk et al. 1995; Umbricht-Schneiter et al. 1994). Recent data on buprenorphine indicate that treatment with this medication, like methadone, has similar positive outcomes (CSAT 2004a; Johnson et al. 2000; Kakko et al. 2003).
Viewing opioid addiction as a medical disorder is consistent with the idea that treatment of even severe cases improves outcomes, just as in other chronic and relapsing medical disorders, even before abstinence is achieved. For example, Metzger and colleagues (1998) found that substance abuse treatment was associated with a significantly lower risk of HIV infection than was nontreatment. Treatment also was associated with a significant reduction, but not necessarily cessation, of drug use for many individuals. Similar findings on the positive health outcomes associated with maintenance treatment of opioid addiction, regardless of whether abstinence was attained, were seen in studies finding that methadone maintenance decreases overdose death. Data on benefits of partial responses to maintenance treatment resemble the benefits of treatment for other chronic medical disorders in terms of symptom alleviation. An analogy with MAT would be the desirability of reducing the risk of HIV infection, overdose, and the many psychosocial complications of addiction, which is not as desirable as the benefits of attaining complete abstinence from opioids but is associated with significantly improved patient health and well-being. The goal is always reducing or eliminating the use of illicit opioids and other illicit drugs and the problematic use of prescription drugs.
The medical community recognizes that opioid addiction is a chronic medical disorder that can be treated effectively with a combination of medication and psychosocial services. An important development in MAT during the 1990s was the 1997 publication of recommendations by a National Institutes of Health consensus panel on effective medical treatment of opiate addiction. After hearing from experts and the public and examining the literature, the panel concluded that ì[opioid addiction] is a medical disorder that can be effectively treated with significant benefits for the patient and societyî (National Institutes of Health 1997b,
p. 18). That panel explicitly rejected the notion ìthat [addiction] is self-induced or a failure of willpower and that efforts to treat it inevitably failî (p. 18). It called for ìa commitment to offer effective treatment for [opioid addiction] to all who need itî (p. 2). The panel also called for Federal and State efforts to reduce the stigma attached to MAT and to expand MAT through increased funding, less restrictive regulation, and efforts to make treatment available in all States (p. 24). The consensus panel for this TIP further recommends that access to treatment with methadone and other FDAapproved medications for opioid addiction be increased for people who are incarcerated, on parole, or on probation.
The trend toward greater acceptance of MAT as an effective treatment for opioid addiction has resulted in fewer State-mandated restrictions for treatment. For example, many States have removed restrictions on the length of time that patients may remain in treatment.
More Treatm ent Prog ram s and More Patients in Treatm ent
In 1993, when TIP 1 was published, approximately 750 registered OTPs were treating some 115,000 patients in 40 States, the District of
Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands (CSAT 1993b, p. 1). At this writing, more than 1,100 OTPs operating in 44 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are treating more than 200,000 patients (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration n.d.b; Nicholas Reuter, personal communication, June 2004). As of this writing, methadone treatment is not available in six States: Idaho, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming.
Most expansion in the treatment system in the past 10 years has occurred in the proprietary sector. Historically, most OTPs were funded publicly, whereas proprietary programs were in the minority. In the 1980s, public funding for methadone treatment began to be reduced, along with State, Federal, and local budgets, and increasingly was replaced by private feefor-service treatment programs in which patients bore more of the costs (Knight et al.
1996a, 1996b; Magura and Rosenblum 2001).
Choices of Medications
The medical community recognizes that opioid addiction is a chronic
medical disorder
that can be treated effectively...
The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has been working to broaden the array of effective treatment medications for chronic opioid addiction. Just after the publication of TIP 1, FDA approved the use of LAAM, although its use has been curtailed substantially since then (see chapter 3). In October 2002, FDA approved two new formulations containing buprenorphine for treatment of opioid addiction. Buprenorphine is used to treat individuals who have been opioid addicted for less than 1 year, as well as patients for whom buprenorphineís unique properties are beneficial (CSAT 2004a). The opioid antagonist naltrexone is available to treat people who are opioid addicted and have undergone medically supervised withdrawal. These medications are discussed in chapter 3.
Treatm ent Options
OTPs can provide several treatment options:
ï Maintenance treatment combines pharmacotherapy with a full program of assessment, psychosocial intervention, and support services; it is the approach with the greatest likelihood of long-term success for many patients.
ï Medical maintenance treatment is provided to
stabilize patients and may include long-term provision of methadone, buprenorphine, LAAM, or naltrexone, with a reduction in clinic attendance and other services. A patient can receive medical maintenance at an OTP, after he or she is stabilized fully. The patient usually must complete a comprehensive treatment program first. The decision about whether to provide medical maintenance must be made by a licensed practitioner. A designated medication unit (e.g., physicianís office, pharmacy, long-term care facility) affiliated with an OTP can provide some medical maintenance services. To reduce clinic attendanceóa key feature of medical maintenanceópatients must qualify, subject to variations in State regulations (which may be more stringent than Federal regulations), to receive 7- to 14-day supplies of methadone for take-home dosing after 1 year of continuous treatment and 15- to 30day supplies after 2 years of continuous treatment in an OTP (if additional criteria are satisfied [see chapter 5]) (42 CFR, Part 8 ß 12(h); Federal Register 66:4079).
ï Detoxification from short-acting opioids involves medication and, perhaps, counseling or other assistance to stabilize patients who are opioid addicted by withdrawing them in a controlled manner from the illicit opioids.
ï Medically supervised withdrawal treatment involves the controlled tapering of treatment medication for patients who want to remain abstinent from opioids without the assistance of medication.
Based on the framework provided by the Drug
Dosage decisions should be appro-
priate and tailored to each patient. 
Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (21 United States Code 823(g)), qualified practitioners are authorized to use SubutexÆand SuboxoneÆ(see
chapter 3) to treat chronic opioid addiction in an office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) or other health care setting.
These alternatives are increasing access to care as OTPs broaden their range of treatment options,
more physicians offer OBOT and become better trained in MAT principles and methods, and individuals with opioid addiction seek new points of treatment entry. At this writing, the availability of these options varies, often because of individual State regulations.
Chang es in the Federal Reg ulatory System
On May 18, 2001, SAMHSA promulgated a new accreditation oversight system. Its goal is to ìreduce the variability in the quality of opioid treatment services, and reform the treatment system to provide for expanded treatment capacityî (Federal Register 64:39814). As OTPs meet these national standards, treatment improvement is expected to continue along with increased attention to program evaluation and quality improvement mechanisms. The consensus panel hopes that this TIP will contribute to the movement toward quality-driven treatment standards.
Rem aining Challeng es
Although important strides have been made, much remains to be done to improve and expand treatment and to address the stigma that affects patients and programs.
Adm inistering Appropriate Dose Levels
The consensus panel believes that programs should monitor and adjust patientsí dose levels of methadone and other opioid treatment medications to ensure that they receive therapeutic dosages without regard to arbitrary dose-level ceilings that are unsupported by research evidence. Dosage decisions should be appropriate and tailored to each patient. Progress has been made to ensure that patients receive the therapeutic dosage levels they need to remain stabilized; however, the panel finds it troubling that some OTPs still fail to prescribe medication in adequate doses (DíAunno and Pollack 2002).
Treating Patients Who Have More Com plex Problem s
Complex problems can complicate patientsí diagnosis and treatment. When TIP 1 was published, the opioid addiction treatment system faced two major challengesóthe spread of HIV/AIDS and the problem of untreated co-occurring disorders. The consensus panel believes that the provision of psychiatric services at or through OTPs has not kept pace with best practices. It is critical that OTPs be prepared to diagnose and treat co-occurring disorders aggressively, either directly or by referral. This issue is discussed in chapter 12.
The treatment system is grappling with the implications of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among people who inject drugs, with estimates of HCV infection in this group ranging from 60 percent on average nationwide (National Institute on Drug Abuse 2000) to 90 percent in some regions (Thomas 2001). OTPs face the challenge of how to provide patient education and HCV testing for people who inject drugs.
Patterns of opioid abuse have changed in the past decade. For example, in some areas of the country, patients are presenting with addiction to pain management medications as a primary admission indication (CSAT 2001a; Office of National Drug Control Policy 2002). OTPs report that patients addicted to pain management medications require higher therapeutic methadone levels than other patients. Since the mid-1990s, the prevalence of lifetime heroin use has increased for both youth and young adults. From 1995 to 2002, the rate among youth ages 12 to 17 increased from 0.1 to 0.4 percent; among young adults ages 18 to 25, the rate rose from 0.8 to 1.6 percent (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2003c).
Prom oting Evidence-Based Treatm ent Services
Throughout this TIP are many examples of types of interventionsócomprehensive MAT, medical maintenance, psychosocial interventions, and moreóand program characteristics that have been demonstrated to improve retention and outcomes for patients. The consensus panel recommends that program administrators and treatment providers compare their practices with these evidence-based practices and make necessary changes where appropriate. Moreover, OTPs should measure their outcomes continuously, using appropriate program evaluation tools, to improve treatment quality (see chapter 14). Finally, OTPs may want to partner with the research community to investigate and adopt new interventions for improving outcomes.
In addition, SAMHSA has established and funded the Addiction Technology Transfer Center (ATTC) Network, which is dedicated to improving the skills and knowledge of substance abuse treatment providers and increasing their awareness of research findings. Regional centers in the ATTC Network seek to accomplish this goal by identifying and advancing opportunities to improve addiction treatment through the dissemination of new information in response to emerging needs and developments in the treatment field. (For more information, visit the ATTC Web site at www.nattc.org.)
Expanding the Treatm ent System
Although the number of patients enrolled in OTPs for addiction treatment has almost doubled since 1993, an estimated 898,000 people chronically or occasionally use heroin in the United States (Office of National Drug Control Policy 2003). Only about 20 percent of people who use heroin are being treated. For people who abuse opioid medications normally obtained by prescription, the percentage in treatment is even lower. 
Lack of funding for services remains a significant barrier to treatment. In many States, Medicaid does not reimburse MAT services; accordingly, patients, many of whom have limited financial resources, are compelled to finance their treatment. 
Making Treatm ent Available to Crim inal Justice Populations
Criminal justice populations are in critical need of opioid addiction treatment, yet most do not have access to MAT (National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse 1998; National
Drug Court Institute 2002; U.S. Department of Justice 1999). Resistance to MAT by many in the criminal justice system may be rooted in the traditional view that medical maintenance treatment is substitution of one drug for another (National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse 1998). The Rikers Island jail facility in New York City has been providing inmates access to methadone treatment since 1987 (National Drug Court Institute 2002). Rhode Island jail facilities offer a 30-day dose-tapering program. The consensus panel understands that few other correctional institutions have provided MAT services. 
Prom oting Com prehensive Treatm ent
In its 1999 publication, Principles of Drug
Addiction Treatment: A Research-Based Guide, NIDA stressed the importance of comprehensive treatment services by devoting 3 of the 13 principles of effective drug addiction treatment to comprehensive care (see Exhibit 1-1) (National Institute on Drug Abuse 1999).
The consensus panel believes that it is critical to emphasize the central importance of comprehensive care as more physicians begin to use buprenorphine to treat chronic opioid addiction in their private offices. Ideally, a full continuum of care should integrate the services of primary care physicians who dispense opioid treatment medications in private offices and other medication units with the services provided by counselors, case managers, and other essential staff in OTPs.

Source: National Institute on Drug Abuse 1999.
For almost a century, the predominant view of opioid addiction has been that it is a selfinduced or self-inflicted condition resulting from a character disorder or moral failing and that this condition is best handled as a criminal matter (see chapter 2). Use of methadone and other therapeutic medications has been viewed traditionally as substitute therapyómerely replacing one addiction with another and the treatment of choice for those too weak to overcome temptation. The stigma associated with MAT has been unique in its permeation of community institutions, affecting the attitudes of medical and health care professionals; social services agencies and workers; paraprofessionals; employers, families, and friends of persons who are opioid addicted; and other people who formerly abused substances, as well as influencing criminal justice policies, creating political opposition, and limiting funding and space for OTPs.
Although diversion control is an important part of MAT, public policy sometimes has seemed to place greater emphasis on protecting society from methadone than on the addiction, violence, and infectious diseases that these medications help alleviate (Institute of Medicine 1995; Joseph et al. 2000; Nadelmann and McNeeley 1996). The cost-effectiveness of MAT often has been overlooked (see chapter 2).
Stigma affects patients in various ways. It discourages them from entering treatment and prompts them to leave treatment early. It creates a barrier for those trying to access other parts of the health care system. A striking example is the failure of many medical practitioners to medicate pain adequately in this group. In addition, the refusal of some organ transplant programs to provide liver transplants to patients maintained on methadone may be a result of stigma, as well as a lack of convincing data on outcomes for methadone patients who receive transplants.
Stigma affects programs too. It prevents new programs from opening when community opposition develops. It can affect a programís internal operations. Staff members who work in OTPs sometimes absorb societyís antipathy toward patients in MAT and may deliver program services with a punitive or countertherapeutic demeanor. OTPs must guard against these attitudes through supervision, education, and leadership efforts (see chapter 14).
Several factors have made the destructive force of stigma particularly intractable, including the isolation of MAT from mainstream medicine, negative media reports about treatment, and the public impressions made by poorly run programs. Fortunately, positive changes are occurring in each area.
Managers and staff members
should develop
effective skills for working with the media. 
Positive stories about MAT in the media are sometimes overshadowed by highly charged negative accounts, for example, stories about patients loitering outside OTPs or diversion of take-home doses. SAMHSA, recognizing that ì[s]ignificant reduction in stigma and changes in attitudes will require a concerted effort based on systematic researchî (CSAT 2000b, p. 4), has undertaken a national educational campaign, titled Partners for
Recovery. Many OTP managers and staff members have isolated themselves from their communities, which contributes to negative stereotypes and media stories. Managers and staff members should
develop effective skills for working with the media. The consensus panel believes that the patient advocacy movement also can advance a national educational campaign about MAT.
Strong efforts are needed to eliminate stigma within OTPs as well. Staff members should treat patients with respect and pay attention to the terms they use. The term ìsubstitution treatmentî should be avoided because it incorrectly implies that long-acting opioid medications act like heroin and other short-acting opioids. Terms such as ìdirtyî and ìcleanî in reference to drug-test specimens should be replaced by more clinically useful terms such as ìpositiveî and ìnegative,î respectively. The use of criminal justice terms such as ìprobationary treatmentî should be replaced with clinically appropriate language (see chapter 14).
Finally, programs should become better neighbors. Idle, perhaps intoxicated, patients who remain near an OTP can become, by default, the programís public representatives and easy targets for complaints from the community. Frequently, patient loitering is a result of insufficient program management. Patient conduct in and around OTPs should be considered both a treatment and a community relations concern.
The Future of MAT
This is an exciting and challenging time for the
MAT field, as positive changes accelerate and reinforce one another. The consensus panel hopes that this publication will advance highquality care in OTPs by providing up-to-date information on science-based, best-treatment practices and by highlighting sound ethical principles of treatment. Equipped with this TIP, the accreditation standards, and a developing alliance with the general medical community, OTPs should be able to improve and expand effective opioid addiction treatment throughout the country.

This chapter describes the history of opioid use and addiction in the United States; changes in the population groups affected by opioid addiction disorders; and this countryís social, political, legal, and medical responses. The chapter emphasizes factors affecting the development and course of medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction (MAT) in opioid treatment programs (OTPs).
Opioid addiction has affected different population groups and socioeconomic classes in the United States at different times. Societyís response has changed along with changes in the groups or classes most affected, shifts in social and political attitudes toward opioid addiction, and the accumulation of more and better information about its causes and treatments (Musto 1999). The consensus panel for this TIP believes that an appreciation for the roots of opioid addiction and treatment is important because attitudes and beliefs about opioid use and addiction that are rooted in U.S. history over the past 150 years continue to influence policies governing MAT.
Em erg ence of Opioid A ddiction as a Sig nificant Problem and the Roots of Controversy
Many of todayís substances of abuse including the opioidsóprimarily opium, morphine, heroin, and some prescription opioidsógained their early popularity as curatives provided by physicians, pharmacists, and others in the healing professions or as ingredients in commercial products ranging from pain elixirs and cough suppressants to beverages. These products usually delivered the benefits for which they were used, at least initially, such as pain relief, increased physical and mental energy (or ìrefreshmentî), and reduced anxiety. For example, opioids were often the best available substances to relieve pain on Civil War battlefields. Unfortunately, the uncontrolled use of opioids either for prescribed and advertised benefits or for nonmedicinal effects leads to

increased tolerance and addiction. Tolerance increases the need for larger quantities of opioids, more frequent use, or combination with other substances to sustain their effects; it also increases the severity of withdrawal when addiction is not satisfied. Recognition of this problem has spurred a long-running debate among patients and people who use opioids, their families, physicians, researchers, community leaders, patient advocates, and government officials. This debate centers on two different
views: (1) opioid addiction is a generally incurable disease that requires long-term maintenance with medication; or (2) opioid addiction stems from weak will, lack of morals, other psychodynamic factors, or an environmentally determined predilection that is rectified by criminalization of uncontrolled use and distribution and measures promoting abstinence.
The Chang ing Face of Opioid Addiction
Opioid addiction first emerged as a serious problem in this country during and after the Civil War, when opioids were prescribed widely to alleviate acute and chronic pain, other types of discomfort, and stress. Although a smaller pattern of nonmedical opioid use continued as well, mainly opium smoking among Chinese immigrants and members of the Caucasian ìundergroundî (e.g., prostitutes, gamblers, petty criminals), iatrogenic addiction was much more common (White 1998). By the late 19th century, probably two-thirds of those addicted to opioids (including opium, morphine, and laudanum) were middle- and upper-class White women, a fact Brecher and the Editors of Consumer Reports (1972, p. 17) attribute to ìthe widespread medical custom of prescribing opiates for menstrual and menopausal discomfort, and the many proprietary opiates prescribed for ëfemale troubles.íî Civil War veterans who were addicted by medical procedures composed another group, but their numbers were dwindling. By 1900, an estimated 300,000 persons were opioid addicted in the United States (Brecher and Editors 1972; Courtwright 2001; Courtwright et al. 1989).
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, U.S. society generally viewed iatrogenic addiction among women and disabled war veterans sympatheticallyóas an unfortunate medical conditionóand treated these groups with tolerance and empathy, particularly because neither group presented major social problems (Courtwright 2001). Doctors usually prescribed more opioids for these patients, and sanatoriums were established for questionable ìcuresî of the resulting addictions. The chronic nature of opioid addiction soon became evident, however, because many people who entered sanatoriums for a cure relapsed to addictive opioid use after discharge. In Eugene OíNeillís autobiographical drama ìLong Dayís Journey Into Night,î for example, his father refuses to return OíNeillís mother, who is addicted, to a sanatorium because he is aware of the addictive qualities of morphine and is resigned to the inevitability of relapse (Courtwright 2001).
By the end of the 19th century, doctors became more cautious in prescribing morphine and other opioids, and the prevalence of opioid addiction decreased. Small groups still practiced opium smoking, but most Americans regarded it as socially irresponsible and immoral. It is noteworthy, however, that heroin, introduced in 1898 as a cough suppressant, also began to be misused for its euphoric qualities, gradually attracting new types of users. This development, along with diffusion of the hypodermic technique of drug administration, which gained popularity between 1910 and 1920, had a profound effect on opioid use and addiction in the 20th century and beyond (Courtwright 2001).
The size and composition of the U.S. opioidaddicted population began to change in the early 20th century with the arrival of waves of European immigrants. Courtwright (2001) portrays most users of opioids of this period as young men in their 20s: ìdown-and-outsî of recent-immigrant European stock who were crowded into tenements and ghettos and acquired their addiction during adolescence or early adulthood. They often resorted to illegal means to obtain their opioids, usually from nonmedical sources and specifically for the euphoric effects. ìGone was the stereotype of the addicted matron; in its place stood that of the street criminalî (Courtwright 2001, p. 1).
The initial treatment response in the early 20th century continued to involve the prescriptive administration of short-acting opioids. By the 1920s, morphine was prescribed or dispensed in numerous municipal treatment programs (Courtwright et al. 1989).
Addictive use of opium, cocaine, and heroin, along with drug-related crime, especially in poor urban communities, increasingly concerned social, religious, and political leaders. The tolerance and empathy shown toward Civil War veterans and middle-aged women evaporated; negative attitudes toward and discrimination against new immigrants probably colored views of addiction. Immigrants and others who trafficked in and abused drugs were viewed as a threat. As detailed below, societyís response was to turn from rudimentary forms of treatment to law enforcement (Brecher and Editors 1972; Courtwright 2001; Courtwright et al. 1989). For more on trends in the 1920s and 1930s, see ìEarly treatment effortsî below.
McCoy (n.d.) refers to a forced decline in opioid addiction during World War II, brought about by restrictions on shipping and strict port security, which produced a marked hiatus in global opium trafficking and caused the U.S. opioid-addicted population to drop to a historic low of about 20,000. Once smuggling resumed after the war, the population that had used opioids resumed the habit.
Another major change in the U.S. opioidaddicted population occurred after World War II. As many European immigrants moved from crowded cities, Hispanics and AfricanAmericans moved into areas with preexisting opioid abuse problems, and the more susceptible people in these groups acquired the disorder (Courtwright 2001; Courtwright et al. 1989).
The post-World War II shift in the composition of opioid-addicted groups coincided with hardening attitudes toward these groups, leading some researchers to conclude that stigmatization of people with addiction disorders and their substances of abuse reflected, at least in part, class and ethnic biases. A portion of U.S. society appeared to view with disdain and fear the poor White, Asian, African-American, and Hispanic people with addiction disorders who lived in the inner-city ghettos (Courtwright et al. 1989).
Brecher and the Editors of Consumer Reports (1972) point out that, by the mid-1960s, the number of middle-class young White Americans using heroin was on the rise, as was addictionrelated crime. By the 1970s, U.S. military involvement in Vietnam also was having an effect. From one-fourth (Brecher and Editors 1972) to one-half (Courtwright 2001) of American enlisted men in Vietnam were believed to have used or become addicted to heroin; however, White (1998) points out that the feared epidemic of heroin addiction among returning veterans did not materialize fully. He concludes, ìVietnam demonstrated that a pattern of drug use could emerge in response to a particular environment and that spontaneous remission could occur when the environment was changedî (p. 303).
By the 1980s, an estimated 500,000 Americans used illicit opioids (mainly heroin), mostly poor young minority men and women in the inner cities. Although this number represented a 66-percent increase over the estimated number of late 19th-century Americans with opioid addiction, the per capita rate was much less than in the late 19th century because the population had more than doubled (Courtwright et al. 1989). Nevertheless, addiction became not only a major medical problem but also an explosive social issue (Courtwright 2001; Courtwright et al. 1989).
By the end of the 1990s, an estimated 898,000 people in the United States chronically or occasionally used heroin (Office of National Drug Control Policy 2003), and the number seeking treatment was approximately 200,000 (almost double the number during the 1980s). The abuse of opioids that normally were obtained by prescription was a growing concern because of both their damaging effects and their potential as gateway drugs to other substance use. Treatment admission rates for addiction to opioid analgesics more than doubled between 1992 and 2001 (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2004), and visits to emergency rooms related to opioid analgesic abuse increased 117 percent between 1994 and 2001 (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2003b).
Societyís Chang ing Response The Harrison Narcotic A ct of 1914
The Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, which required medicines containing opioids to say so on their labels, was the first national response to the changing image of people with addictions (Brecher and Editors 1972). The Harrison
Narcotic Act of 1914 was the earliest significant Federal attempt to place strict controls on opioids and other substances (Brecher and Editors 1972). Although U.S. mercantile and trade interests were also at stake, the widely held perception that people with addictions generally were members of a White criminal underclass or a Chinese minority has been portrayed as an underlying motivation for the statute (Courtwright 2001; Courtwright et al. 1989). The Harrison Act was conceived not as a prohibition law but as a measure to regulate the manufacture, distribution, and prescription of opioids, coca, and their derivatives. Under the actís provisions, manufacturers, pharmacists, and physicians had to be licensed, keep records for inspection, and pay modest fees to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, referred to hereafter as Treasury. 
The act permitted physicians and dentists to dispense or distribute opioids ìto a patient . . . in the course of [the physicianís] professional practice onlyî (38 Stat. 786 [1914]). Although this provision permitted physicians to prescribe or dispense opioids so long as they kept the required records, Treasury interpreted the act as a prohibition on physiciansí prescribing opioids to persons with addictions to maintain their addictions. (Treasury was the agency responsible for enforcing the Harrison Act as well as prohibition laws.) Treasuryís position appeared to be that addiction is not a disease and the person with an addiction, therefore, was not a patient. It followed that any physician prescribing or dispensing opioids to such individuals was not doing so in the ìcourse of his professional practiceî (White 1998). In 1919, the United States Supreme Court upheld Treasuryís interpretation. This interpretation and enforcement of the Harrison Act effectively ended, until well into the 1960s, any legitimate role for the general medical profession in medication-assisted treatment for Americans who had drug addictions (White 1998).
Early treatment efforts
Until the 1919 Supreme Court decision upholding Treasuryís interpretation of the Harrison Act, numerous municipalities with large numbers of residents who were opioid addicted were operating treatment clinics in which morphine was prescribed or dispensed. Some clinics prescribed heroin and cocaine (Courtwright et al. 1989). These early OTPs varied in how they functioned; some provided detoxification treatment and others adopted a maintenance policy (Courtwright 2001; Gewirtz 1969). Perhaps the best known of these early OTPs were the Department of Health program in New York City, where those with addictions were detoxified with decreasing doses of heroin and morphine, and the program established by Dr. Willis Butler in Shreveport, Louisiana, which not only detoxified patients but also maintained some of them on morphine (Courtwright et al. 1989).
Courtwright and others state that Treasury regarded these clinics as a threat to its antimaintenance philosophy. By the early 1920s, it had succeeded in closing them through legal pressure, critical inspections, and threats. The last program to be closed was Dr. Butlerís in Shreveport (Courtwright 2001; Courtwright et al. 1989).
In the 1920s, an increase in crime related to the acquisition of illicit opioids was reported in cities throughout the country. In 1929, Congress appropriated funds to establish two new treatment facilities, initially called ìnarcotics farmsî (White 1998), in Fort Worth, Texas, and Lexington, Kentucky. The
Lexington facility, which opened to patients in
1935, was renamed the U.S. Public Health Service Narcotics Hospital in 1936. These institutions detoxified patients with opioid addiction who entered voluntarily, and they also served as hospitals for prison inmates who had opioid addictions and were legally committed through a Federal court. The prescribed stay was about 6 months, although some patients stayed longer. Prisoners could stay for up to 10 years. These hospitals offered social, medical, psychological, and psychiatric services in addition to detoxification and had a low patient-to-staff ratio (about 2 to 1), but the atmosphere was described as prisonlike, especially at the Lexington facility (White 1998). Two major followup studies showed the program to be a failure. One reported a relapse rate of 93 percent in 1,881 former patients over a 1.0- to 4.5-year followup period (Hunt and Odoroff 1962). The second found a relapse rate of 97 percent in 453 former patients over followup periods of 6 months to 5 years (Duvall et al. 1963). The Lexington hospital facility was turned over to the Bureau of Prisons in 1974 (Courtwright et al. 1989). Despite the failure of these programs, White credits the research conducted there with providing ìmuch of the foundation upon which modern treatment advances were builtî (White 1998, p. 126).
The increase in heroin addiction in New York City after World War II led, in 1952, to the establishment of Riverside Hospital for adolescents with addiction disorders. This program also proved to be a failure. A followup study in 1956 showed a high posttreatment relapse rate
(e.g., at least 86 percent of patients admitted in 1955), and the Riverside facility was closed in 1961 (Brecher and Editors 1972).
Experiment in civil commitment
Civil commitment is portrayed by Brecher and the Editors of Consumer Reports (1972) and White (1998) as legislation enabling those with substance addiction and those ìin imminent danger of becoming addictedî (White 1998, p. 250) to be confined in rehabilitation centers without having first committed or been convicted of a crime. Civil commitment was instituted

in California and New York in the 1960s to allay fears about addiction-related crimes against people and property in the inner cities. People with addictions could be committed to facilities through a voluntary process that included a medical examination to validate the presence of an addiction, or they could be committed for 3 years when arrested on a misdemeanor charge, as an alternative to a jail sentence. The civil commitment program instituted in New York in 1966 turned out to be exceedingly expensive, and the positive results were minimal (Brecher and Editors 1972; Inciardi 1988). The great majority of those admitted, treated, and paroled to aftercare programs dropped out of these programs, and they usually could not be located. A review of Californiaís civil commitment experience in the 1960s showed that five of every six patients committed for addictions and subsequently placed on aftercare relapsed, were rearrested, dropped out of treatment, died, or were removed from the program by writs of habeas corpus (Joseph 1988; Joseph and Dole 1970).
Although statutes permitting involuntary commitment might remain on the books in some States, such laws rarely have been used to commit people who abuse substances and who are not under criminal justice jurisdiction (Anglin 1988). Court decisions after the 1960s generally have required that an individual be a danger to himself or herself or others before the legal system can use involuntary commitment (e.g., OíConnor v. Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563, 1975).
The search for alternatives
In New York, death rates associated with the injection of heroin increased from 7.2 to 35.8 per 10,000 deaths between 1950 and 1961 (Frank 2000; Joseph et al. 2000). In the 1960s and 1970s, more than 150,000 names were

added to the Narcotics Register in New York City. (The Narcotics Register, active from 1967 to 1974, was a list of known or suspected persons with addictions.)
By the middle to late 1960s, illicitñopioid-related mortality had become the leading cause of death for young adults from ages 15 to 35 in New York City. The number of serum hepatitis (now called hepatitis B) cases related to contaminated needles also was increasing. Record numbers of people with opioid addictions were arrested for drug-related crimes (e.g., possession, sales, robbery, burglary), and overcrowded jails had no effective method to ease detoxification (Inciardi 1988; Joseph and Dole 1970). By 1968, the Manhattan County Jail for Men (also known as the Tombs) had been wracked by riots blamed on poor living conditions, severe overcrowding, and lack of medical care for inmates with drug addictions.
As the incidence of addiction and related criminal activity rose dramatically in urban areas, concern grew in the legal and medical communities because increased incarceration had failed to stem the tide. The legal and medical professions were perturbed by the post-World War II rise in opioid addiction in the United States and the ineffectiveness of Federal regulatory policy. In 1958, a joint committee of the American Bar Association and the American Medical Association (AMA) issued a report recommending that an outpatient facility prescribing opioids to treat addiction be established on a controlled experimental basis (Brecher and Editors 1972).
Other groups voiced support for the concept of opioid maintenance programs. The New York Academy of Medicine recommended, in 1955 and again in 1963, that clinics be established in affiliation with hospitals to dispense opioids in a controlled manner to patients addicted to illicit opioids. In 1956, the AMA advocated a research project to investigate the feasibility of dispensing opioids in an OTP. In 1963, the Kennedy administrationís Advisory Commission on Narcotic and Drug Abuse also recommended research to determine the effectiveness of outpatient OTPsí dispensing of opioids to people addicted to opioids (Brecher and Editors 1972). In the early 1970s, faced with increased opioidrelated drug use and crimes, the Nixon administration greatly increased funding to stem the supply of illicit opioids, primarily heroin, entering the United States. It also greatly increased funding for methadone maintenance, and the number of patients receiving methadone increased from 9,000 in 1971 to 73,000 in 1973 (Courtwright 2001). Support for opioid maintenance grew, especially because no effective psychosocial alternative existed to treat the large number of people with opioid addictions.
Orig ins of Opioid Maintenance Therapy
Developm ent of Medications To Treat Opioid Addiction Early rationale for methadone maintenance treatment
In 1962, Dr. Vincent P. Dole, a specialist in metabolism at The Rockefeller University, became chair of the Narcotics Committee of the Health Research Council of New York City. After studying the scientific, public health, and social ramifications of addiction in the city, he received a grant to establish a research unit to investigate the feasibility of opioid maintenance. In preparing for this research, he read The Drug Addict as a Patient by Dr. Marie E. Nyswander (Nyswander 1956), a psychiatrist with extensive experience treating patients who were addicted to opioids. She was convinced that these individuals could be treated within general medical practice. She also believed that many would have to be maintained on opioids for extended periods to function because a significant number of people who attempted abstinence without medication relapsed, in spite of detoxifications, hospitalizations, and psychotherapy (Brecher and Editors 1972; Courtwright et al. 1989). Dr. Nyswander joined Dr. Doleís research staff in 1964. Among others joining the team was clinical investigator Dr. Mary Jeanne Kreek.
These researchers realized that morphine, which is related to heroin, was not a good choice as an opioid maintenance drug because patientsí social functioning was impaired by morphineís sedating effects (White 1998). Also, the short half-life of morphine required several injections per day, and, as tolerance developed, increasing amounts were needed over a short time for patients to remain stable (Brecher and Editors 1972). Other short-acting opioids, such as heroin, codeine, oxycodone, and meperidine (DemerolÆ), showed similar results (Dole 1980, 1988).
Development of methadone
With short-acting opioids eliminated as options for maintenance therapy, research focused on methadone. Methadone appeared to be longer acting and effective when administered orally. It also was selected on the basis of observations of its use in patients withdrawing from heroin and as an analgesic in the experimental treatment of pain (Dole 1980, 1988). In 1964, technology was not available to measure blood levels of heroin, morphine, or methadone to assess duration of action. Proof of the efficacy of methadone maintenance treatment depended on observation and recognition by researchers.
In an initial study, methadone was administered to two patients previously maintained on morphine. Once tolerance for daily doses of 50 to 120 mg was established, patients could function normally without the anxiety associated with drug craving (White 1998). During this research, the following important findings about methadone maintenance were noted, all supporting its efficacy and benefits (Dole 1980, 1988):
ï Patients did not experience euphoric, tranquilizing, or analgesic effects. Their affect and consciousness were normal. Therefore, they could socialize and work normally without the incapacitating effects of short-acting opioids such as morphine or heroin.
ï A therapeutic, appropriate dose of methadone reduced or blocked the euphoric and tranquilizing effects of all opioid drugs examined (e.g., morphine, heroin, meperidine, and opium), regardless of whether a patient injected or smoked the drugs.
ï No change usually occurred in tolerance levels for methadone over time, unlike for morphine and other opioids; therefore, a dose could be held constant for extended periods (more than 20 years in some cases). 
ï Methadone was effective when administered orally. Because it has a half-life of 24 to 36 hours, patients could take it once a day without using a syringe.
ï Methadone relieved the opioid craving or hunger that patients with addiction described as a major factor in relapse and continued illegal use.
ï Methadone, like most opioid-class drugs,
caused what were considered minimal side effects, and research indicated that methadone was medically safe and nontoxic.
Expansion of methadone maintenance from research project to public health program
In 1965, the initial research project on methadone safety and efficacy was transferred to Manhattan General Hospital in New York City (Brecher and Editors 1972). Because Dole and his colleagues knew that an independent evaluation of this new treatment would be necessary, a team headed by Dr. Frances Rowe Gearing was formed at Columbia University School of Public Health to evaluate patient progress as this treatment expanded. In general, the team found that patientsí social functioning improved with time in treatment, as measured by elimination of illicit-opioid use and better outcomes in employment, school attendance, and homemaking. Most patients were stabilized on methadone doses of 80 to 120 mg/day. Most patients who remained in treatment subsequently eliminated illicit-opioid use. However, 20 percent or more of these patients also had entered treatment with alcohol and polysubstance abuse problems, despite intake screening that attempted to eliminate these patients from treatment (Gearing and Schweitzer 1974). Methadone treatment was continued for these patients, along with attempts to treat their alcoholism and polysubstance abuse. Further evaluation, research, and expansion of the program ultimately were recommended (Joseph and Dole 1970) and instituted. Methadone maintenance became a major public health initiative to treat opioid addiction under the leadership of Dr. Jerome Jaffe, who headed the Special Action Office for Drug Abuse
Prevention in the Executive Office of the White House in the early 1970s. Dr. Jaffeís office oversaw the creation of a nationwide, publicly funded system of treatment programs for opioid addiction.
Development of LA A M
Like methadone, levo-alpha acetyl methadol
(LAAM) was classified as a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) schedule II controlled substance (i.e., having a high potential for abuse but also a currently accepted medical use) that creates a pharmacologic cross-tolerance for other opioids and therefore blocks their euphoric effects while controlling opioid craving. Whereas methadone suppressed opioid withdrawal symptoms for 24 hours or longer, LAAM achieved this effect for 48 to 72 hours or longer.
LAAM was first developed in 1948 by German chemists as an analgesic (Finn and Wilcock 1997). By the late 1960s, interest arose in
LAAM as an alternative to methadone
(American Association for the Treatment of
Opioid Dependence n.d.). Between 1969 and 1981, 27 separate studies of more than 6,000 patients established LAAMís safety and efficacy (National Institute on Drug Abuse 1993a). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved LAAM for use in OTPs in July 1993 (National Institute on Drug Abuse 1993a).
Later studies continued to confirm that LAAM was an effective alternative to methadone and was preferred by some patients (Glanz et al. 1997). However, in April 2001, based on reported LAAM-related disturbances in cardiac function, FDA and Roxane Laboratories, Inc., manufacturer of ORLAAMÆ, strengthened the warnings in LAAM product labeling (Haehl 2001). The American Association for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence has issued clinical guidelines for LAAM (American Association for the Treatment of Opioid
Dependence n.d.). At this writing, only 3 percent of patients enrolled in maintenance programs in the United States are receiving LAAM (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2002a).
In 2003, Roxane Laboratories announced that it would stop producing LAAM on January 1, 2004 (Schobelock 2003), making LAAMís continued availability doubtful. This TIP continues to include basic, limited coverage of LAAM in discussions of opioid medications because of its clinical significance and relevance in MAT.
Development of buprenorphine
Information on the development of the latest successful maintenance medication, buprenorphine, is in ìDEA classification of buprenorphineî below and TIP 40, Clinical Guidelines for the Use of Buprenorphine in the Treatment of Opioid Addiction (CSAT 2004a).
Development of naltrexone
Naltrexone is the only pure opioid antagonist of the medications described here (see chapter 3). In the early 1980s, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) completed initial testing of naltrexone to treat opioid addiction, and FDA approved naltrexone for this use in 1984. In 1995, naltrexone also received FDA approval as a preventive treatment for relapse to alcohol use among patients dependent on alcohol. Some opioid treatment providers have found that naltrexone is most useful for highly motivated patients who have undergone detoxification from opioids and need additional support to avoid relapse or who desire an expedited detoxification schedule because of external circumstances. Naltrexone also may benefit some patients in the beginning stages of opioid use and addiction. Other patient groups frequently have demonstrated poor compliance with long-term naltrexone therapy, mainly because naltrexone neither eases craving for the effects of illicit opioids when used as directed nor produces withdrawal symptoms when discontinued (Tai et al. 2001).
Public Policy Studies and Reports Since 1993
Analyses since the publication of TIP 1 have shown that maintenance treatment for opioid addiction is effective in both treatment outcomes and costs.
California Drug and Alcohol Treatment A ssessment
AnalysesÖhave shown that main-
tenance treatment for opioid addic-
tion is effective in
both treatment outcomes and costs.
In 1994, the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs published the results of a pioneering largescale study of the effectiveness, benefits, and costs of substance abuse treatment in California. Using State databases, provider records, and followup interviews with treatment participants, the study detailed the effects of treatment on participant behavior including drug and alcohol use, criminal activity, health, health care use, and income; the costs of treatment; and the economic value of treatment to society (Gerstein et al. 1994). 
Among the California Drug and Alcohol Treatment Assessmentís findings were the following:
ï Treatment was cost beneficial to taxpayers, with the cost averaging $7 returned for every dollar invested (Gerstein et al. 1994). ìEach day of treatment paid for itself (the benefits to taxpaying citizens equaled or exceeded the costs) on the day it was received, primarily through an avoidance of crimeî (Gerstein et al. 1994, p. iv). ìRegardless of the modality of care, treatment-related economic savings outweighed costs by at least 4 to 1î (Gerstein et al. 1994, p. 90).
ï Methadone treatment was among the most cost-effective treatments, yielding savings of $3 to $4 for every dollar spent. This was true for each major methadone treatment modality, but costs were lower in an outpatient OTP than in a residential or social modality (Gerstein et al. 1994).
ï Patients in methadone maintenance showed the greatest reduction in intensity of heroin use, down by two-thirds, of any type of opioid addiction treatment studied.
ï Patients in methadone maintenance showed the greatest reductions in criminal activity and drug selling, down 84 percent and 86 percent, respectively, of any type of opioid addiction treatment studied.
ï Health care use decreased for all treatment modalities; participants in methadone maintenance treatment showed the greatest reduction in the number of days of hospitalization, down 57.6 percent, of any modality.
Institute of Medicine
For more than three decades,
methadoneís use to treat addiction has been subjected to
extensive Federal,
State, and local regulation.
In 1995, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) produced a study titled Federal Regulation of Methadone Treatment (Institute of Medicine 1995). This study concluded that FDA regulations were inhibiting physicians from exercising their professional judgment; isolating methadone treatment from mainstream medicine, thereby depriving patients of important ancillary services; and discouraging research into new medications. This IOM study recommended that the Federal regulatory process be modified to
ï Encourage programs to provide comprehen-
sive services, such as individual and group counseling and medical care
ï Emphasize the need for continuing clinical assessment throughout treatment
ï End arbitrary restrictions on OTP practices.
National Institutes of Health
In 1997, a National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus panel called for expansion of methadone maintenance treatment. It identified such barriers as the publicís misperception of persons who are opioid addicted not as individuals with a disease but as ìotherî or ìdifferent,î the misperception ìthat [addiction] is selfinduced or a failure of willpower and that efforts to treat it inevitably fail,î and overregulation of methadone treatment that limits the flexibility and responsiveness of treatment programs (National Institutes of Health 1997b). That panel called for the following:
ï Federal leadership to inform the public that opioid addiction is a medical disorder that can be treated effectively, with significant benefits for the patient and society
ï Access to methadone treatment for persons
under legal supervision (e.g., probation, parole, incarceration)
ï Increase in funding for methadone maintenance treatment
ï Reduction in unnecessary regulation of MAT,
including
ñ Replacement of FDA regulation and 
oversight of MAT with more effective, less expensive measures, such as accreditation, to improve the quality of methadone treatment
ñ Revision of DEA regulations to eliminate the extra level of regulation placed on methadone compared with other schedule II opioids, thereby encouraging more physicians and pharmacies to prescribe and dispense methadone and making maintenance treatment available in more locations
ñ Faster approval of new medications for
MAT by FDA and the States ñ Expansion of the availability of maintenance pharmacotherapy to States and programs where it is currently unavailable.
Reg ulatory History
For more than three decades, methadoneís use to treat addiction has been subjected to extensive Federal, State, and local regulation. (For a detailed history of Federal regulation of methadone treatment, see chapter 5 in the IOM report [1995] edited by Rettig and Yarmolinsky.)
Law s Related to Controlled Substances as Addiction Treatm ent Medications
Congress has enacted several significant statutes since 1970 to limit and control the availability of psychoactive drugs and their use to treat addiction.
Controlled Substances A ct (1970)
The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (Public Law [P.L.] 91ñ513) requires all manufacturers, distributors, and practitioners who prescribe, dispense, or administer controlled substances to register with DEA. A physician seeking registration must meet certain standards established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and must comply with regulations established by the U.S. Attorney General regarding security of opioid stocks and maintenance of records.
Narcotic A ddict Treatment A ct (1974)
In passing the Narcotic Addict Treatment Act of 1974 (P.L. 93ñ281), which amended the Controlled Substances Act, Congress recognized the use of an opioid drug to treat opioid addiction as critical and, for the first time in Federal law, defined ìmaintenance treatment.î To promote closer monitoring of programs that use opioids for maintenance treatment, the law required separate DEA registration by medical practitioners who dispense opioid drugs in the treatment of opioid addiction. Previously, any physician with a DEA registration could prescribe methadone for pain management or addiction treatment. This act also increased coordination between the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and DEA. Under its provisions, before a practitioner can obtain registration from DEA, DHHS must determine that the practitioner is qualified according to established treatment standards.
The Narcotic Addict Treatment Act also established NIDA as an institute independent of the National Institute of Mental Health. Authority to regulate the treatment of opioid addiction was split between NIDA and FDA. NIDA became responsible for determining appropriate standards for medical, scientific, and public health aspects of drug abuse treatment. FDA received the authority to determine the safety and effectiveness of drugs and approve new drugs for opioid addiction treatment.

B]) amended that portion of the Controlled Substances Act mandating separate registration for practitioners who dispense opioids in addiction treatment. It allows practitioners who meet certain qualifying criteria to dispense or prescribe schedule III, IV, or V controlled substances specifically approved by FDA for MAT. Chapter 3 describes the specific requirements that physicians must satisfy under DATA provisions, including the requirement that physicians must have the capacity to refer patients for needed counseling and other ancillary services.
DEA classification of buprenorphine
On October 8, 2002, DEA completed its evaluation of buprenorphine, classifying it as a schedule III drug (i.e., having potential for abuse and a currently accepted medical use in treatment but less potential for addiction than schedule II drugs). FDA made buprenorphine the first drug approved for treatment of opioid addiction in physiciansí offices (CSAT 2004a; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2003a; see also chapter 3).
History of Methadone Reg ulation Federal regulation
The new regulations
acknowledged that addiction is a 
medical disorder not amenable to one-size-fits-all treatment.
In 1972, FDA issued regulations governing eligibility, evaluation procedures, dosages, take-home medications, frequency of patient visits, medical and psychiatric services, counseling, support services, and related details for methadone treatment programs. Several modifications were made to these regulations during the 1980s. Until 2001, FDA was responsible for approving these programs and ensuring compliance with FDA regulations.
As experience with the effectiveness of methadone grew, criticism of the 1972 FDA regulations increased from physicians, who complained that the regulations placed burdens on their practice of medicine, and from addiction treatment specialists, who pointed out that proscriptive regulations failed to leave room for treatment innovation. (See comments on the new rules in their proposed form [Federal Register 64:39812ñ39814].)
The movement away from a compliance orientation and toward an accreditation model was supported by a number of reviews, including the 1997 NIH consensus development conference on Effective Treatment of Opiate Addiction and the review of 1972 FDA regulations by IOM (Institute of Medicine 1995). Interest in accreditation grew because of its emphasis on self-assessment and improvement and on integration of quality assurance and performance elements developed by expert accreditation organizations. In addition, trends in national health care fueled movement toward accreditation. Many managed care organizations require all accredited health care practitioners to demonstrate quality care. Several States grant exemptions from State licensing requirements (called ìdeemed statusî) to accredited health care facilities.
Final regulations issued by DHHS and the
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA) on January 17,
2001, effective May 18, 2001, govern the use of methadone and LAAM in both maintenance and detoxification treatments for opioid addiction. The 1972 FDA regulations were repealed, and a new accreditation-based regulatory system was created. The new system shifted administration and oversight from FDA to SAMHSA. The new regulations acknowledged that addiction is a medical disorder not amenable to one-size-fits-all treatment. They recognized that different patients, at different times, could need vastly different services.
Accreditation itself is a peer-review process that evaluates a treatment program against SAMHSAís opioid treatment standards and accreditation standards of SAMHSA-approved accrediting bodies (42 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 8). It includes site visits by specialists with experience in opioid pharmacotherapy and related activities.
The new regulations establish an entirely different regulatory and oversight structure for MAT. The DEA role remains the same, but FDAís authority to approve and monitor programs has been transferred to SAMHSA.
Instead of detailed proscriptive rules, the new regulations set forth general certification requirements and Federal opioid treatment standards. These are elaborated in bestpractice guidelines and in accreditation ìelementsî (or standards) developed by the SAMHSA-approved accreditation bodies. SAMHSA has employed a series of expert panels to develop guidelines for an accreditationbased certification system. Placing detailed practice criteria in accreditation standards rather than in regulations permits SAMHSA and the accreditation bodies to update the standards as needed.
The new regulations provide that, once a program is accredited, SAMHSA uses accreditation results along with other data to determine whether the program is qualified to carry out treatment under the standards in the regulations. SAMHSA maintains oversight of accreditation elements in its review of accreditation bodiesí initial and renewal applications. 
The consensus panel for this TIP expects the accreditation process to result in an integrated and individualized approach to services, increased patient satisfaction, better staff recruitment, enhanced community confidence and outcomes, and improvements in quality of care. The shift to accreditation enables SAMHSA to focus its oversight efforts on improving treatment rather than ensuring that programs are meeting regulatory criteria.
States
The new Federal regulations preserve Statesí authority to regulate OTPs. Oversight of treatment medications remains a tripartite system involving States, DHHS/SAMHSA, and the U.S. Department of Justice/DEA.
States can monitor the same areas as Federal agencies, but State rules do not always echo Federal regulations. Some States have established medical recertification requirements for continuation of comprehensive, long-term MAT after a specified period. Other State and local requirements, such as certificates of need, zoning, and licensure, can affect the number, size, and location of OTPs. These regulations are not affected by the change in Federal regulations.

This chapter reviews the pharmacology and clinical applications of the principal medications used to treat opioid addiction in opioid treatment programs (OTPs), including the opioid agonists methadone and levoalpha acetyl methadol (LAAM), the partial opioid agonist buprenorphine, and the opioid antagonist naltrexone. Coverage of LAAM is brief because its future availability is uncertain. Coverage of buprenorphine is short because TIP 40, Clinical Guidelines for the Use of Buprenorphine in the Treatment of Opioid Addiction (CSAT 2004a), discusses its pharmacology in more detail. Coverage of naltrexone is short because its use in the United States generally has been limited to easing withdrawal symptoms for a small portion of patients undergoing medically supervised withdrawal after maintenance treatment. Exhibit 3-1 provides information about these and other medications for opioid addiction treatment, including the year of their U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and their U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) drug schedule assignment.
The most frequently used medication for opioid addiction treatment in OTPs is methadone, and much of this chapter focuses on methadone pharmacology. LAAM always has been used much less than methadone, and its use was reduced further in 2001, after it was associated with cardiac arrhythmia in some patients. That association led FDA to warn that LAAM be used only for patients not responding well to methadone. That warning and other factors led the manufacturer to cease production of LAAM on January 1, 2004 (Schobelock 2003), making its continued availability uncertain after depletion of existing stocks. Programs were encouraged to transfer patients using LAAM to other treatments. Another pharmaceutical company may manufacture and distribute LAAM in the future.
FDA approved buprenorphine on October 8, 2002, for use in medical maintenance treatment and medically supervised withdrawal. It is the first partial opioid agonist in recent U.S. history available for use by certified physicians outside the traditional opioid treatment delivery system and the strict requirements of the Narcotic Addict Treatment Act of 1974

(see chapter 2). In addition, on May 22, 2003, an interim rule change made buprenorphine available for use in OTPs that receive certification from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to dispense buprenorphine. Physicians working in medical offices or other appropriate settings must obtain a waiver from SAMHSA to use buprenorphine to treat opioid addiction (see Exhibit 3-2). Qualified physicians may dispense or prescribe buprenorphine products for up to 30 patients at a time under the provisions of the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (DATA). (More information about DATA and waivers can be found at www.buprenorphine. samhsa.gov; also see Boatwright 2002.)
The consensus panel for this TIP expects that the availability of buprenorphine in multiple settings will increase the number of patients in treatment and that its availability in physiciansí offices and other medical and health care settings should help move medical maintenance treatment of opioid addiction into mainstream medical practice.

Pharm acolog y and Pharm acotherapy
Methadone and LAAM
The synthetic opioids methadone and LAAM are the only long-acting full opioid agonists approved for opioid pharmacotherapy at this writing. Opioid agonists bind to the mu opiate receptors on the surfaces of brain cells, which mediate the analgesic and other effects of opioids. Methadone and LAAM produce a range of mu agonist effects similar to those of shortacting opioids. Therapeutically appropriate doses of these agonist medications produce cross-tolerance for short-acting opioids such as morphine and heroin, thereby suppressing withdrawal symptoms and opioid craving as a short-acting opioid is eliminated from the body. The dose needed to produce cross-tolerance depends on a patientís level of tolerance for short-acting opioids.
LAAM is longer acting than methadone. Unlike methadone, it cannot be administered daily because its longer duration of action would lead to accumulation of toxic levels in the body that could result in death (Roxane Laboratories, Inc., 2001). Articles by Oda and Kharasch (2001) and Walsh and colleagues (1998), as well as the manufacturerís package insert for ORLAAMÆ(Roxane Laboratories, Inc., 2001), provide more information on LAAMís pharmacology.
When given intramuscularly or orally, methadone suppresses pain for 4 to 6 hours. Intramuscular methadone is used only for patients who cannot take oral methadone, for example, patients in medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction (MAT) who are admitted to a hospital for emergency medical procedures. Methadone should not be given parenterally in an OTP.
Because of its extensive bioavailability and longer half-life, an adequate daily oral dose of methadone suppresses withdrawal and drug craving for 24 to 36 hours in most patients who are opioid addicted. Patients with special needs may require split methadone doses given more than once daily. Methadone is metabolized chiefly by the cytochrome P3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme system (Oda and Kharasch 2001), which is significant when methadone is coadministered with other medications that also operate along this metabolic pathway (see ìInteractions With Other Therapeutic Medicationsî below).
After patient induction into methadone pharmacotherapy, a steady-state concentration (i.e., the level at which the amount of drug entering the body equals the amount being excreted) of methadone usually is achieved in 5 to 7.5 days (four to five half-lives of the drug). Methadoneís pharmacological profile supports sustained activity at the mu opiate receptors, which allows substantial normalization of many physiological disturbances resulting from the repeated cycles of intoxication and withdrawal associated with addiction to short-acting opioids. Therapeutically appropriate doses of methadone also attenuate or block the euphoric effects of heroin and other opioids. Goodman and Gilmanís Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (Hardman et al. 2001) provides a comprehensive description of methadoneís pharmacological effects.
Methadone is up to 80 percent orally bioavailable, and its elimination half-life ranges from 24 to 36 hours. When methadone is administered daily in steady oral doses, its level in blood should maintain a 24-hour asymptomatic state, without episodes of overmedication or withdrawal (Payte and Zweben 1998). Methadoneís body clearance rate varies considerably between individuals. The serum methadone level (SML) and elimination halflife are influenced by several factors including pregnancy and a patientís absorption, metabolism and protein binding, changes in urinary pH, use of other medications, diet, physical condition, age, and use of vitamin and herbal products (Payte and Zweben 1998).
Measuring methadone via SMLs helps determine how much is circulating in patientsí systems. In a typical 24-hour period after dosing, SMLs should peak after about 2 to 4 hours and decline gradually to trough levels thereafter (Payte and Zweben 1998). Although researchers have noted a strong correlation between methadone dosage and serum concentrations in some patients, the relationship is not necessarily linear, and a high degree of variation exists among patients (reviewed by Leavitt et al. 2000). The rate-of-change ratio between peak and trough SMLs can be useful clinically; Payte and Zweben (1998) suggested that peak SMLs should not exceed twice the trough levels.
Researchers have found that trough SMLs of 150 to 600 ng/mL are necessary to suppress drug craving (reviewed in Leavitt et al. 2000). Many treatment providers consider that trough SMLs of $400 ng/mL provide adequate opioid cross-tolerance, thereby controlling patientsí opioid abuse; however, Eap and colleagues (2002) found no studies that validated these minimum trough levels.
Methadone has two enantiomeric forms, ì(R)-î
(also called levo- or L-) methadone and ì(S)-î (dextro- or D-) methadone, which have the same chemical formula but different spatial arrangements. OTPs in the United States use a 50:50 racemic mixture of these two enantiomers. Only (R)-methadone has clinically significant mu receptor agonist activity, and its potency as an analgesic is 50 times greater than that of (S)methadone (Eap et al. 2002). (R)-methadone also has a significantly higher mean clearance rate than (S)-methadone (Eap et al. 1999).
Methadone is metabolized into inactive metabolites, mainly in the liver by CYP450 enzymes, but probably also by enzymes in the intestines. These metabolites are then excreted. Drugs that induce or inhibit this enzyme activity can affect methadone metabolism. If these enzymes are stimulated by other medications, the duration of methadoneís effect and SMLs may be lowered, precipitating withdrawal symptoms. If these enzymes are inhibited by other medications, methadone metabolism may be slowed, and the SMLs and duration of methadoneís effect in patients may be increased (Eap et al. 2002; Leavitt et al. 2000; Payte and Zweben 1998).
[A]n adequate daily oral dose of methadone 
suppresses with-
drawal and drug craving for 24 to 36 hours...
Several CYP450 isoforms help metabolize methadone, including CYP3A4 (the most abundant), CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and possibly, but to a smaller extent, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 (Cozza and Armstrong 2001; Eap et al. 2002; Gerber et al. 2004). Different enzymes metabolize (R)- and (S)-methadone differently. Numerous genetic and environmental factors affect these enzymes and account for variations in methadone metabolism among individuals. Some enzymes also play a part in metabolizing other medications, such as benzodiazepines, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, antibiotics, and antiviral agents (e.g., HIV protease inhibitors). Through their effects on these enzymes, some medications can raise or lower patientsí SMLs. Especially during initiation of methadone maintenance, methadone can increase CYP3A4 activity, thereby accelerating its own metabolism in some individuals (Eap et al. 2002; Leavitt et al. 2000).
CYP2D6 selectively metabolizes the (R)methadone enantiomer. Production of this enzyme is affected by genetic factors. A small portion of the population does not produce much CYP2D6, whereas others have very high CYP2D6 activity. The latter group may require much higher methadone doses to compensate for their high rate of (R)-methadone metabolism (Eap et al. 2002; Leavitt et al. 2000). Individuals also differ considerably in CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 activity, accounting in part for the wide variations in methadone metabolism (Eap et al. 2002).
Buprenorphine
Buprenorphine, a derivative of the opium alkaloid thebaine, is a synthetic opioid and generally is described as a partial agonist at the mu opiate receptor and an antagonist at the kappa receptor. Research has demonstrated that buprenorphineís partial agonist effects at mu receptors, its unusually high affinity for these receptors, and its slow dissociation from them are principal determinants of its pharmacological profile (Cowan 2003).
In the 1990s, researchers determined that, as a partial mu agonist, buprenorphine does not activate mu receptors fully (i.e., it has low intrinsic activity), resulting in a ceiling effect that prevents larger doses of buprenorphine from producing greater agonist effects (Walsh et al. 1994). As a result, there is a greater margin of safety from death by respiratory depression when increased doses of buprenorphine are used, compared with increased doses of full opioid agonists. Buprenorphine overdose is uncommon, although it has been reported in France, and it is associated almost always with injection of buprenorphine coupled with ingestion of high doses of benzodiazepines, alcohol, or other sedative-type substances (Kintz 2001, 2002). Another feature of  buprenorphine is that it can be used on a daily or less-than-daily basis. Typically, the interdosing interval is extended by doubling or tripling the daily dose to permit alternate-day or thrice weekly dosing (Amass et al. 2000, 2001), which is possible because, although larger doses do not increase buprenorphineís agonist activity, they do lengthen its duration of action (Chawarski et al. 1999).
Buprenorphine also may be an excellent agent to facilitate detoxification from illicit opioids and abused prescription opioids. Although it has a relatively short plasma half-life (about 4 to 6 hours), buprenorphine has a long duration of action resulting from its high affinity for and correspondingly slow dissociation from the mu receptor (Cowan 2003). This slow dissociation likely reduces the magnitude of withdrawal symptoms during detoxification (Johnson et al. 2003b). Some evidence supports a short-term course of buprenorphine-naloxone therapy for detoxification from opioids.
Buprenorphine is metabolized in the liver by the CYP3A4 subgroup of CYP450 enzymes (Kobayashi et al. 1998), and, like methadone and LAAM, its rate of metabolism is affected by coadministration of other medications metabolized along this pathway.
Depending on the dosage, buprenorphine activity can be viewed as falling between that of full agonists, such as methadone and LAAM, and antagonists, such as naltrexone (Exhibit 3-3) (Johnson et al. 2003b). Because it is a partial agonist at higher doses, buprenorphine also can precipitate opioidlike withdrawal symptoms in patients with high levels of physical dependence on opioids, making it appear to function more like an antagonist under these conditions (see ìInductionî in chapter 5).
Naltrexone
Naltrexone is a highly effective opioid antagonist that tightly binds to mu opiate receptors. Because it has a higher affinity for these receptors than has heroin, morphine, or methadone, naltrexone displaces those drugs from receptors and blocks their effects. It can, therefore, precipitate withdrawal in patients who have not been abstinent from short-acting opioids for at least 7 days and have not been abstinent from long-acting ones, such as methadone, for at least 10 days (OíConnor and Fiellin 2000). Naltrexone displaces buprenorphine to a lesser degree, but, in high enough doses, it overrides buprenorphineís activity as well.
Because naltrexone has no narcotic effect, there are no withdrawal symptoms when a patient stops using naltrexone, nor does naltrexone have abuse potential. Early research concluded that tolerance does not develop for naltrexoneís antagonist properties, even after many months of regular use (Kleber et al. 1985). A 50 mg tablet markedly attenuates or blocks opioid effects for 24 hours, and a 100 to 150 mg dose can block opioid effects for up to 72 hours (OíBrien et al. 1975).
The FDA approved naltrexone for maintenance treatment in 1984 based on its pharmacological effects, without requiring proof of its efficacy in clinical trials for opioid addiction treatment. Despite its potential advantages, it has had little impact on the treatment of opioid addiction in the United States, primarily because of poor patient compliance (OíConnor and Fiellin 2000). 
Dosag e Form s
Methadone
Methadone is provided in various forms, including diskettes, tablets, oral solution, liquid concentrate, and powder. In the United States, methadone used in MAT almost always is administered orally in liquid form. Parenteral administration is prohibited in OTPs. Parenteral abuse of methadone is not widespread, and people rarely inject the methadone dispensed in U.S. OTPs because it is mixed with substances (e.g., flavored drinks) that make injection unattractive.
In a...study comparing the efficacy of LAAM...,
buprenorphine...,
and methadone..., all three medica-
tions substantially reduced illicit opioid use.
Approved forms of methadone for oral administration are supplied in various doses and concentrations, allowing OTPs to choose which to dispense on the basis of clinic and patient preferences, convenience, and cost. The diskette form comprises scored tablets, which are dissolved in water, mixed with a flavored liquid, and taken orally. Advantages are easy inventory and the ability for patients to see what they are taking before water is added. The
diskette is not suited, however, for small dose increments and decrements. Methadone tablets, which dissolve in water, can be used in conjunction with diskettes for small dose changes; however, tablets normally are used only for analgesic applications; OTPs favor forms less subject to diversion. The liquid concentrate form offers complete dosing flexibility, particularly with a computer-assisted dispensing pump system. The powder form can be mixed with water into a solution.
LAAM
LAAM is supplied to OTPs as a colorless liquid to be taken orally. When LAAM was approved, Federal regulations required OTPs to ensure that ìdosage forms of LAAM and methadone are easily distinguishedî (21 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 291 ß 505). Therefore, OTPs color LAAM to distinguish it from methadone.
Buprenorphine
Buprenorphine is available in sublingual tablets containing either buprenorphine alone (sometimes called monotherapy tablets and marketed under the name Subutex) or combined with naloxone (called combination therapy tablets with the trade name Suboxone). For the combination therapy tablet, the ratio of buprenorphine to naloxone is 4 mg of buprenorphine to 1 mg of naloxone. The combination tablet was developed because of problems with injection abuse of buprenorphine reported outside the United States, where injection of buprenorphine is not permitted for treatment. Injected alone, buprenorphine precipitates withdrawal symptoms in most patients who are opioid addicted, and the addition of naloxone increases this likelihood. The combination tablet may precipitate acute withdrawal. Withdrawal also may be precipitated if too much or too little buprenorphine is given or if it is administered while the opioid receptors are highly occupied by an opioid agonist. Therefore, physicians need to be careful when timing the initiation of buprenorphine induction.
Naltrexone
Naltrexone was first produced by DuPont under the trade name ReviaÆ. However, it is now produced by Mallinckrodt under the trade name DepadeÆand is supplied in 25, 50, and 100 mg tablets.
Efficacy
Methadone
Methadone maintenance has been demonstrated repeatedly to be safe and effective when used with appropriate safeguards and psychosocial services (OíConnor and Fiellin 2000). Maintenance treatment typically leads to reduction or cessation of illicit opioid use and its adverse consequences, including cellulitis, hepatitis, and HIV infection from use of nonsterile injection equipment, as well as criminal behavior associated with obtaining drugs. Methadone pharmacotherapy has been shown to lead to improved overall adjustment, including reductions in psychiatric symptoms, unemployment, and family or social problems. Mattick and colleagues (2003) provide complete reviews of the effectiveness of methadone.
LAAM
Controlled clinical trials generally have established that LAAM is as effective as methadone and buprenorphine in reducing illicit-opioid use and retaining patients in treatment when equipotent doses are compared (e.g., Johnson et al. 2000; White et al. 2002). Appel and colleagues (2001) provide more information on LAAMís efficacy.
Buprenorphine
The primary efficacy of buprenorphine in clinical trials was demonstrated via patient retention and elimination of illicitñopioidpositive drug tests. Compared with equipotent doses of both methadone and LAAM, buprenorphine produced similar rates of treatment retention and abstinence from illicit opioids. In a controlled, randomized study comparing the efficacy of LAAM (75 to 115 mg), buprenorphine sublingual solution (16 to 32 mg), and methadone (60 to 100 mg), all three medications substantially reduced illicit opioid use (Johnson et al. 2000).
Johnson and colleagues (2003b) reviewed numerous studies evaluating the efficacy of buprenorphine for maintenance treatment lasting up to 1 year. These studies have shown that daily doses of 8 mg of sublingual solution or 8 to 16 mg of the buprenorphine tablet are safe and well tolerated. Most studies comparing buprenorphine and methadone have shown that 8 mg of sublingual buprenorphine or 16 mg of the tablet per day is equivalent to approximately 60 mg of oral methadone per day. A study by Fudala and colleagues (2003) demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the buprenorphine-naloxone combination tablet in office-based settings.
Naltrexone
Naltrexone is highly effective in preventing relapse when used as directed. However, most studies have indicated very high (70 to 80 percent) dropout rates from naltrexone therapy (Stine et al. 2003). A study by Rothenberg and colleagues (2002) found especially poor retention levels for patients who had received methadone before naltrexone treatment (none of them completed 6 months of treatment, compared with 31 percent of patients who had not received methadone before naltrexone therapy). Other studies have demonstrated better compliance when naltrexone therapy is supported with payment scheduling and vouchers (e.g., Preston et al. 1999b).
Side Effects
Long-term methadone, LAAM, or buprenorphine therapy is associated with few side effects. Although patients typically have high levels of medical and mental disorders, most result from preexisting problems or the consequences of addiction, not from the treatment medication (Institute of Medicine 1995). Chapter 10 provides a review of related medical problems in patients who are opioid addicted.
The most common adverse effects reported by patients receiving methadone or LAAM are constipation, which is caused by slowed gastric motility, and sweating; a similar side effect profile is seen for buprenorphine. Other side effects include insomnia or early awakening and decreased libido or sexual performance (Hardman et al. 2001). Possible side effects reported after regular use of these medications are listed in Exhibit 3-4.

Cardiovascular Effects Methadone
Methadone has been shown to increase QT intervals in at least two studies (i.e., Krantz et al. 2003; Martell et al. 2003). A QT interval is that part of a patientís electrocardiogram reading that begins at the onset of the QRS complex and extends to the end of the T wave. The QT interval represents the time between the start of ventricular depolarization and the end of ventricular repolarization. The QT interval normally varies depending on heart rate, age, and gender. The QT interval may be influenced by electrolyte balance, medications, and ischemia. A prolonged QT interval increases the risk of developing a cardiac arrhythmia called torsade de pointes. 
Cases of torsade de pointes have been reported in patients taking high doses of methadone (mean daily doses of approximately 400 mg). Although information about this effect is limited, 6 of 17 patients who developed torsade de pointes in one study had an increase in their methadone dose during the month preceding arrhythmia (Krantz et al. 2003). This finding supported the possibility that methadone contributed to the development of arrhythmia. Furthermore, Martell and colleagues (2003) showed that, regardless of dose, a statistically significant increase occurred in QT intervals during the first 2 months of treatment. Practitioners should be aware of potential QTprolonging effects of methadone, especially at high doses, and should be aware of interactions with other medications that also have QTprolonging properties or with medications that slow the elimination of methadone.  
LA A M
LAAM has been associated with prolonged QT interval in some patients and, in rare cases, with death from torsade de pointes arrhythmia. As a result, it has been taken off the market in Europe, and it has been given a ìblack boxî warning (i.e., a required warning on the package insert and other product-related materials) in the United States by FDA. These findings have led to discontinuation of LAAM therapy for new patients by most American OTPs. Currently, it is labeled for use only when no other treatment option exists or for continuing use in patients who already have demonstrated tolerability for the medication (Roxane Laboratories, Inc., 2001).
Before a patient is started on LAAM, providers must follow informed-consent procedures about QT interval prolongation and provide information about the possibility of arrhythmia and sudden death (CSAT 1999b). Patients should be screened for cardiac risk factors, including preexisting prolonged QT intervals or other cardiac problems (Food and Drug Administration 2001; Schwetz 2001).

Approximately 10 percent of patients receiving naltrexone have gastrointestinal side effects (e.g., nausea and vomiting) that may necessitate stopping the medication. Most patients, however, experience only mild, transient stomach upset (Stine et al. 2003). Naltrexone also can cause anxiety, nervousness, insomnia, headache, joint or muscle pain, and tiredness in some patients (National Library of Medicine 1997).
Effects on the Im m une System
Short-acting opioids such as heroin and morphine interfere with the normal activity of the immune system, perhaps through stress hormones such as cortisol, which are known to suppress immune function. These effects are not seen with methadone, which does not appear to affect natural killer cell activity, immunoglobulin, or T or B cells (Novick et al. 1989). 
Effects on the Liver
Methadone, LAAM, and buprenorphine are metabolized by the liver, but no evidence exists that they are hepatotoxic (Joseph et al. 2000). Because the liver is a major storage site for these medications, patients with liver disease should be expected to metabolize opioid-based medications more slowly, which might raise blood levels of these medications but lower their stores and shorten their duration of action. Abnormal liver functions among patients maintained on these drugs usually are caused by viral infections, most commonly hepatitis C acquired from contaminated needles, or by cirrhosis secondary to alcoholism (Marray 1992). Chapter 10 provides information on medical conditions commonly seen in patients who are opioid addicted.
Although the presence of liver disease is not a reason to exclude patients from MAT, severe persistent liver disease in these patients indicates the need to monitor liver functions regularly and to use caution in dosage adjustment. Severe liver impairment might result in toxic serum levels of an opioid medication. Symptoms of toxic levels include poor concentration, drowsiness, dizziness when standing, and excessive anxiety (sometimes called feeling ìwiredî). These effects usually can be managed by dose reduction. The consensus panel and the FDA labels on Subutex and Suboxone recommend baseline and periodic liver function testing for patients receiving buprenorphine.
In evaluating naltrexone to treat alcoholism, a Center for Substance Abuse Treatment consensus panel (CSAT 1998a) recommended caution in using naltrexone for patients who have high (three times normal) serum transaminase levels. OTPs should perform liver function tests before naltrexone therapy and periodically thereafter to ensure healthy liver function. For the relatively few cases in which liver toxicity occurs, treatment should be discontinued after determining that the liver problem has no other cause.
Side Effects of Buprenorphine
Johnson and colleagues (2003b) reported that buprenorphine in solution or tablet and the combination buprenorphine-naloxone tablet were well tolerated. Few serious side effects have been reported in studies involving more than 5,000 patients, although, like other opioids, buprenorphine can produce constipation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and dizziness (Fudala et al. 2003; Ling et al. 1998). Increases in liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) were observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine who also were positive for hepatitis C (Petry et al. 2000). At this writing, 53 cases of buprenorphine-associated hepatitis have been reported in France since 1996 (Auriacombe et al. 2003). One report suggested an association between injection buprenorphine misuse and liver toxicity, possibly from buprenorphineís increased bioavailability when administered parenterally (Berson et al. 2001). The direct role of buprenorphine in these abnormalities is unclear because many individuals in these studies might have had hepatitis B or C. Additional studies are needed to clarify this issue.
Interactions With
Other Therapeutic Medications 
Because methadone, LAAM, and buprenorphine are metabolized chiefly by the CYP3A4 enzyme system (a part of the CYP450 system), drugs that inhibit or induce the CYP450 system can alter the pharmacokinetic properties of these medications. Drugs that inhibit or induce this system can cause clinically significant increases or decreases, respectively, in serum and tissue levels of opioid medications. 
Drugs that induce the CYP450 enzyme system can precipitate withdrawal in patients receiving methadone, LAAM, or buprenorphine. Most notable are certain medications used to treat HIV infection, such as nelfinavir (McCanceKatz et al. 2000), efavirenz (Clarke, S.M., et al. 2001b), and nevirapine (Clarke, S.M., et al. 2001a; Otero et al. 1999). Other common inducers are carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital (Michalets 1998).
Psychiatric medications sharing the same metabolic pathways as methadone and LAAM include some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which inhibit the isoenzymes that metabolize methadone and might increase SMLs (Nemeroff et al. 1996). Hamilton and colleagues (2000), who examined SMLs in patients who were depressed, receiving the SSRI sertraline, and undergoing methadone pharmacotherapy, found that sertraline produced modest increases in SMLs during the first 6 weeks of treatment. They concluded that patients who are methadone maintained and receiving SSRIs should be monitored for altered SMLs. However, because clinical experience with patients in MAT who take SSRIs has not indicated that these alterations are clinically significant, the consensus panel recommends careful monitoring of these patients but not routine testing of their SMLs. Of all the SSRIs, fluvoxamine likely has the most potential to cause excessive SMLs while patients are receiving it and decreased SMLs after patients discontinue it (Alderman and Frith 1999).
Fluvoxamine has been implicated in oversedation and respiratory depression when combined with methadone (Alderman and Frith 1999).
Earlier studies showed that methadone increased serum levels of tricyclic antidepressants, indicating that the oral doses required for a therapeutic response to tricyclics might be lower than those needed for a positive response in patients not addicted to opioids (Maany et al. 1989).
Finally, rifampin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital (used occasionally for the treatment of seizure disorders), and some medications to treat HIV infection (see chapter 10) also may induce liver enzymes that speed the bodyís transformation of methadone. Patients taking these medications might need increases in their methadone dosage or split doses to maintain stability.

Exhibit 3-6 provides a list of other substances that are known to induce or inhibit CYP3A4 and potentially could affect levels of methadone, LAAM, and buprenorphine.
Little information is available on the interaction of naltrexone with other medications. Lethargy and somnolence have been reported when naltrexone is used along with ThorazineÆ (chlorpromazine) or MellarilÆ(thioridazine), and caution should be taken when naltrexone is used with other antipsychotic drugs. Patients taking naltrexone experience significant blockade of opioid effects from medications taken for analgesia. However, this blockade is present only when naltrexone is taken regularly; it will cease 24 to 72 hours after naltrexone is discontinued (OíConnor and Fiellin 2000).
Strateg ies To Prevent or Minim ize Harm ful Drug Interactions in MAT
To control patientsí vulnerability to adverse cardiac and other harmful effects of drug interactions with methadone or LAAM, the consensus panel recommends obtaining a thorough drug and medication history, including results of drug and other laboratory tests. In some cases, particularly when patients are treated in multiple settings, consolidating this information can be a challenge.

Treatment providers should rely on their experience, intuition, and common sense to anticipate and circumvent negative drug interactions. The traditional advice when adding drugs to a therapeutic regimen is to start with 
low doses, increase slowly, and monitor closely. In many cases, medication dosages lower than those recommended by the manufacturer may be sufficient for the desired therapeutic effect (Cohen 1999). This is especially prudent for patients receiving agonist medications who have a positive diagnosis for cardiac risk factors.
Educating patients about the risks of drug interaction is essential. The following information should be emphasized:
ï During any agonist-based pharmacotherapy, abusing drugs or medications that are respiratory depressants (e.g., alcohol, other opioid agonists, benzodiazepines) may be fatal.
ï Current or potential cardiovascular risk factors may be aggravated by opioid agonist pharmacotherapy, but certain treatment strategies reduce cardiovascular risk (and should be included as needed in patientsí treatment plans).
ï Other drugsóillicit, prescribed, or over the counteróhave potential to interact with opioid agonist medications (specific, relevant information should be provided).
ï Patients should know the symptoms of arrhythmia, such as palpitations, dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, or seizures, and should seek immediate medical attention when they occur.
ï Maintaining and not exceeding dosage 
schedules, amounts, and other medication regimens are important to avoid adverse drug interactions.
Researchers (e.g., Cohen 1999; Levy et al. 2000; Piscitelli and Rodvold 2001) have provided other suggestions for treatment providers to minimize harmful drug interactions in MAT:
ï When possible, substitute alternative 
medications that do not interact with opioid treatment medications (e.g., azithromycin for erythromycin [because the latter is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor] or divalproex for carbamazepine [because the latter is a potent CYP3A4 inducer]).
ï When other medications must be coadministered with opioid treatment medications, select those that have the least potential for interaction.
ï Consider whether significant adverse drug interactions might be ameliorated by administering a medication with or without food or by altering dosing schedules.
ï Be aware that, the more complicated the medication regimen, the less likely patients will adhere to it, necessitating increased vigilance on the part of treatment providers as the complexity of medication treatment increases.
ï When potentially interactive medications are coadministered, adjust the agonist or partial agonist dosage based on patient response, rather than prophylactically basing the dosage on expected interaction, because degrees of interaction vary dramatically; prejudging the amount of a necessary dosage adjustment is unlikely to work.
ï When opioid medication dosage must be adjusted to compensate for the effects of interacting drugs, observe patients for signs or symptoms of opioid withdrawal or sedation to determine whether they are undermedicated or overmedicated.
ï When a potentially interactive drug combina-
tion must be used and concerns exist about adverse effects if opioid medication is increased, for example, in patients with preexisting cardiovascular conditions, closely monitor drug serum concentrations or increase testing frequency. Advise patients of the physical signs or symptoms of adverse interactions, and tell them what to do if these indicators occur.
ï Be aware of concomitant preexisting diseases (e.g., diseases that decrease renal or hepatic function) and preexisting cardiovascular conditions that might influence the potential for adverse drug interactions.
Knowledge about medication interactions with methadone and other medications used in the treatment of opioid addiction is changing constantly. The reader is advised to check for the most current information on a regular basis. A useful Web site is medicine.iupui.edu/flockhart.
Safety
Methadone and LAAM
The safety profiles of methadone and LAAM are excellent when these drugs are taken as directed by the manufacturer and, for LAAM, when patients are screened carefully for any cardiac risk factors. However, because both methadone and LAAM are full mu opioid agonists, overdose and death can occur if they are taken in larger amounts than directed and in amounts exceeding patientsí tolerance levels. Unintended, possibly lethal respiratory depressant effects also can occur if these medications are used in combination with substances that depress the central nervous system, such as alcohol and benzodiazepines.
Buprenorphine
Like methadone, buprenorphine generally is safe and well tolerated when used as recommended by the manufacturer, and buprenorphineís partial agonist characteristics reduce the risk of respiratory depression from overdose.
Buprenorphine overdose deaths reported in France generally have been attributed to the concurrent parenteral abuse of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines (Kintz 2001; Reynaud et al. 1998; Tracqui et al. 1998a, 1998b). Only two overdose deaths have been attributed to buprenorphine alone (Kintz 2002). The potential for injection abuse with buprenorphine is believed lower than with full agonists because, as a partial agonist, buprenorphine can precipitate withdrawal in individuals who are opioid addicted. Moreover, use of combination buprenorphine-naloxone tablets in the United States should mitigate further the risk of abuse. As with any agonist-based pharmacotherapy, however, it is extremely important to educate patients about the potential lethality of abusing treatment medication alone or in combination with respiratory depressants, especially benzodiazepines.
Naltrexone
Naltrexone generally is safe when used according to the manufacturerís directions. Hall and Wodak (1999) cautioned that overdose rates for patients on naltrexone who relapse to heroin use might be higher than among patients receiving other treatments for opioid addiction. Further investigation is needed to validate this concern.

Assessment
Comprehensive Assessment
Initial screening or intake procedures determine an applicantís eligibility and readiness for medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction (MAT) and admission to an opioid treatment program (OTP). Ongoing assessment should begin as soon as a patient is admitted to an OTP. It provides a basis for individualized treatment planning and increases the likelihood of positive outcomes.
No single tool incorporates all the important elements for assessing patients in MAT. The Addiction Severity Index (ASI) (McLellan et al. 1992), although not comprehensive, can guide collection of the basic information needed to measure patient conditions and progress objectively. Recent research (e.g., Bovasso et al. 2001) continues to support the validity of ASI composite scores. The consensus panel recommends that OTPs develop tools and methods for more extensive assessment. This chapter describes screening and assessment procedures and important considerations that might be made during and shortly after admission to an OTP, as well as assessment techniques and considerations that are important to ongoing MAT.
Initial Screening
First Contact
The screening process begins when an applicant or family member first contacts an OTP, often via telephone or a visit to the OTP. This contact is the first opportunity for treatment providers to establish an effective therapeutic alliance among staff members, patients, and patientsí families. Careful planning for and interaction with new applicants and their families contribute to positive MAT outcomes. Staff members should be prepared to provide immediate, practical information that helps potential applicants make decisions about MAT, including the approximate length of time from first contact to admission, what to expect during the admission process, and types of services offered. A brief exploration of

applicantsí expectations and circumstances can reveal other information they need for considering MAT.
Goals of Initial Screening
The consensus panel recommends the following goals for initial screening:
ï Crisis intervention. Identification of and immediate assistance with crisis and emergency situations (see ìScreening of Emergencies and Need for Emergency Careî below)
ï Eligibility verification. Assurance that an applicant satisfies Federal and State regulations and program criteria for admission to an OTP ï Clarification of the treatment alliance. Explanation of patient and program responsibilities
ï Education. Communication of essential information about MAT and OTP operations (e.g., dosing schedules, OTP hours, treatment requirements, addiction as a brain disease) and discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of MAT to help applicants make informed decisions about treatment
ï Identification of treatment barriers. Determination of factors that might hinder an applicantís ability to meet treatment requirements, for example, lack of childcare or transportation.
Along with these primary goals, initial screening can begin to identify other medical and psychosocial risk factors that could affect treatment, including factors related to mental disorders; legal difficulties; other substance use; and vocational, financial, transportation, and family concerns. Cultural, ethnic, and spiritual factors that affect communication and might affect treatment planning should be noted as early as possible. Staff members should obtain enough information from applicants to accommodate needs arising from any of these factors if necessary.
Screening of Em erg encies and Need for Em erg ency Care
The consensus panel recommends that providers develop medically, legally, and ethically sound policies to address patient emergencies. Emergencies can occur at any time but are most common during induction to MAT and the acute treatment phase (see chapter 7). In particular, patients who exhibit symptoms that could jeopardize their or othersí safety should be referred immediately for inpatient medical or psychiatric care. If possible, staff members who conduct initial screening and assessment should make appropriate referrals before applicants are admitted to an OTP. Identifying and assessing emergencies may require staff familiarity with the components of a mental health status examination (see ìPsychosocial Assessmentî below).
Suicidality
In a study of population data from the U.S. National Comorbidity Survey, a significant association was found between opioid addiction and increased risk of suicide (Borges et al. 2000). Initial screening and periodic assessments should help determine whether those indicating risks of suicide need additional services (e.g., hospitalization for protection or treatment, outpatient mental treatment, or evaluation for antidepressant medication).
Exhibit 4-1 lists some indicators of suicidality. Exhibit 4-2 lists recommended responses.
Homicidality and threats of violence
Threats should be taken seriously. For example, if an individual with knowledge of OTP procedures and schedules makes a threat, patterns of interaction between staff and this individual should be shifted. It might be necessary to change or stagger departure times, implement a buddy system, or use an escort service (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 1996). Counseling assignments can be changed, or patients can be transferred to another OTP.

The consensus panel recommends that OTP staff members receive training in recognizing and responding to the signs of potential patient violence. OTPs should develop policies and procedures for homicide and other violent situations. The OTPís policy on violence and threats of violence should be explained at the beginning of treatment. Emergency screening and assessment procedures should include the following:
ï Asking the patient questions specific to 
homicidal ideation, including thoughts, plans, gestures, or attempts in the past year; weapons charges; and previous arrests, restraining orders, or other legal procedures related to real or potential violence at home or the workplace.
ï Documenting violent incidents and diligent monitoring of these records to assess the nature and magnitude of workplace violence and to quantify risk. When a threat appears imminent, all legal, human resource, employee assistance, community mental health, and law enforcement resources should be readied to respond immediately (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 1996).
A dm ission Procedures and Initial Evaluation
After initial applicant screening, the admission process should be thorough and facilitate timely enrollment in the OTP. This process usually marks patientsí first substantial exposure to the treatment system, including its personnel, other patients, available services, rules, and requirements. The admission process should be designed to engage new patients positively while screening for and assessing problems and needs that might affect MAT interventions. 
Tim ely Adm ission, Waiting Lists, and Referrals
The longer the delays between first contact, initial screening, and admission and the more appointments required to complete these procedures, the fewer the applicants who actually enter treatment. Prompt, efficient orientation and evaluation contribute to the therapeutic nature of the admission process.
If a program is at capacity, admitting staff should advise applicants immediately of a waiting list and provide one or more referrals to programs that can meet their treatment needs more quickly. A centralized intake process across programs can facilitate the admission process, particularly when applicants must be referred. For example, if an applicant accepts referral to another provider, telephone contact by the originating program often can facilitate the applicantís acceptance into the referral program. If an applicant goes willingly to another program for immediate treatment but prefers admission to the original OTP, the admission process should be completed and the applicantís name added to the waiting list.
Patients who prefer to await treatment at the original site should be added to the waiting list and contacted periodically to determine whether they want to continue waiting or be referred. For individuals who are ineligible, staff should assess the need for other acute services and promptly make appropriate referrals. The consensus panel recommends that each OTP establish criteria to decide which prequalified patients should receive admission priority, especially when a program is near capacity. For example, some programs offer high-priority admission to pregnant women, addicted spouses of current patients, applicants with HIV infection or other serious medical conditions, or former patients who have tapered off maintenance medication but subsequently require renewed treatment.
Interim Maintenance Treatm ent
For eligible individuals who cannot be admitted to a public or nonprofit program for comprehensive maintenance services within a reasonable geographic area and within 14 days of applying, 42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 8 ß 12(j), provides for ìinterim maintenance treatment,î in which medication is administered to patients at an OTP for up to 120 days without formal screening or admission and with only minimal drug testing, assuming the existence of reasonable criteria at the OTP to prioritize admissions.
Denial of Adm ission
Denial of admission to an OTP should be based on sound clinical practices and the best interests of both the applicant and the OTP. Admission denial should be considered, for example, if an applicant is threatening or violent. Continuity of care should be considered, and referral to more suitable programs should be the rule. Due process and attention to applicant rights (see CSAT 2004b) minimize the possibility that decisions to deny admission to an OTP are abusive or arbitrary.
Adm ission Team
OTPs should have qualified, compassionate, well-trained multidisciplinary teams (see chapter 6) that efficiently collect applicantsí information and histories, evaluate their needs as patients, and orient them to MAT. Team members should be cross-trained in treating addiction and co-occurring disorders. Those conducting admission interviews should be culturally competent, and their interactions with applicants should not be stigmatizing. They also should be able to communicate OTP policies and services and make appropriate referrals.
Inform ation Collection and Dissem ination
Collection of patient information and dissemination of program information occur by various methods, such as by telephone; through a receptionist; and through handbooks, information packets, and questionnaires. Medical assessments (e.g., physical examinations, blood work) and psychosocial assessments also are necessary to gather specific types of information. Although collection procedures differ among OTPs, the consensus panel recommends that the following types of information be collected, documented, or communicated to patients:
ï Treatment history. An OTP should obtain

positively while
screening for and
assessing problems and needs...
a new patientís substance abuse treatment history, preferably from previous treatment providers, including information such as use of other substances while in treatment, dates and durations of treatment, patterns of success or failure, and reasons for discharge or dropout. Written consent from a patient is required to obtain information from other programs (see CSAT 2004b). (See below for details on other components to include in this history.) ï Orientation to MAT.
[A]ddressing concerns about
and stressing the benefits of MAT
...are essential to long-term treatment retention...
All patients should receive an orientation to MAT, generally extending over several sessions and including an explanation of treatment methods, options, and requirements and the roles and responsibilities of those involved. Each new patient also should receive a handbook (or other appropriate materials), written at an understandable level in the patientís first language if possible, that includes all relevant program-specific information needed to comply with treatment requirements. Patient orientation should be documented carefully for medical and legal reasons. Documentation should show that patients have been informed of all aspects of the multifaceted MAT process and its information requirements, including (1) the consent to treatment (CSAT 2004b), (2) program recordkeeping and confidentiality requirements (e.g., who has access to records and when, who can divulge information without patient consent [see CSAT 2004b]), (3) program rules, including patient rights, grievance procedures, and circumstances under which a patient can be discharged involuntarily, and (4) facility safety instructions (e.g., emergency exit routes). OTPs should require patients to sign or initial a form documenting their participation in the orien-
tation process. Also, patients must receive and sign a written consent to treatment form (see Appendix 4-A; see also CSAT 2004b), which is kept on file by the OTP.
ï Age of applicant. Persons younger than age 18 must meet specific Federal and State requirements (at this writing, some States prohibit MAT for this group), and an OTP must secure parental or other guardian consent to start adolescents on MAT (see discussion below of exemptions from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administrationís [SAMHSAís] 1-year dependence duration rule).
ï Recovery environment. A patientís living environment, including the social network, those living in the residence, and stability of housing, can support or jeopardize treatment.
ï Suicide and other emergency risks. (See above.)
ï Substances of abuse. A patientís substance abuse history should be recorded, focusing first on opioid use, including severity and age at onset of physical addiction, as well as use patterns over the past year, especially the previous 30 days. A baseline determination of current addiction should meet, to the extent possible, accepted medical criteria. Many people who are opioid addicted use other
drugs and alcohol; this multiple substance use has definite implications for treatment outcomes (see ìSubstance Use Assessmentî below and chapter 11). Therefore, screening and medical assessment also should identify and document nonopioid substance use and determine whether an alternative intervention (e.g., inpatient detoxification) is necessary or possible before an applicant is admitted to the OTP.
ï Prescription drug and over-the-counter medication use. All prescription drug and over-the-counter medication use should be identified. Procedures should be in place to determine any instances of misuse, overdose, or addiction, especially for psychiatric or pain medications. The potential for drug interactions, particularly with opioid treatment medications, should be noted (see chapter 3).
ï Method and level of opioid use. The general frequency, amounts, and routes of opioid use should be recorded. If opioids are injected, the risk of communicable diseases (e.g., HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, endocarditis) increases. Patient reporting helps providers assess patientsí substance addiction and tolerance levels, providing a starting point to prescribe appropriate treatment medication for stabilization (American Psychiatric
Association 2000; Mee-Lee et al. 2001a).
ï Pattern of daily preoccupation with opioids. A patientís daily pattern of opioid abuse should be determined. Regular and frequent use to offset withdrawal is a clear indicator of physiological dependence. In addition, people who are opioid addicted spend increasing amounts of time and energy obtaining, using, and responding to the effects of these drugs.
ï Compulsive behaviors. Patients in MAT sometimes have other impulse control disorders. A treatment provider should assess behaviors such as compulsive gambling or sexual behavior to develop a comprehensive perspective on each patient.
ï Patient motivation and reasons for seeking treatment. Prospective patients typically present for treatment because they are in withdrawal and want relief. They often are preoccupied with whether and when they can receive medication. Because successful MAT entails not only short-term relief but a steady, long-term commitment, applicants should be asked why they are seeking treatment, why they chose MAT, and whether they fully understand all available treatment options and the nature of MAT. Negative attitudes toward MAT may reduce patient motivation. However, concerns about motivation should not delay admission unless applicants clearly seem ambivalent. In such cases, treatment providers and applicants can discuss the pros and cons of MAT. The consensus panel believes that identifying and addressing concerns about and stressing the benefits of MAT as early as possible are essential to long-term treatment retention and maintaining patient motivation for treatment.
ï Patient personal recovery resources. A patientís comments also can identify his or her recovery resources. These include comments on satisfaction with marital status and living arrangements; use of leisure time; problems with family members, friends, significant others, neighbors, and coworkers; the patientís view of the severity of these problems; insurance status; and employment, vocational, and educational status. Identification of patient strengths (e.g., stable employment, family support, spirituality, strong motivation for recovery) provides a basis for a focused, individualized, and effective treatment plan (see chapter 6).
ï Scheduling the next appointment. Unless the program can provide assessment and admission on the same day, the next visit should be scheduled for as soon as possible. To facilitate an accurate diagnosis of opioid addiction and prompt administration of the initial dose of medication when other documentation of a patientís condition is unavailable, the applicant should be instructed to report to the OTP while in mild to moderate opioid withdrawal.
Medical A ssessm ent
Medical assessment plays a substantial role in determining MAT eligibility. Some assessment tools and methods mentioned briefly in this chapter are explained further in chapter 10.
The results of medical assessment, including toxicology tests, other laboratory results, and psychosocial assessment, usually are reviewed by a program physician and then submitted to the medical director in preparation for pharmacotherapy. Programs should minimize delay in administering the first dose of medication because, in most cases, applicants will present in some degree of opioid withdrawal.
Determ ination of Opioid Addiction and Verification of Adm ission Elig ibility Federal regulations on eligibility
Federal regulations state that, in general, opioid pharmacotherapy is appropriate for persons who currently are addicted to an opioid drug and became addicted at least 1 year before admission (42 CFR, Part 8 ß 12(e)). Documentation of past addiction might include treatment records or a primary care physicianís report. When an applicantís status is uncertain, admission decisions should be based on drug test results and patient consultations.
Exemptions from SA MHSAís 1-year dependence duration rule
If appropriate, a program physician can invoke an exception to the 1-year addiction history requirement for patients released from correctional facilities (within 6 months after release), pregnant patients (program physician must certify pregnancy), and previously treated patients (up to 2 years after discharge) (42 CFR, Part 8 ß 12(e)(3)).
A person younger than 18 must have undergone at least two documented attempts at detoxification or outpatient psychosocial treatment within 12 months to be eligible for maintenance treatment. A parent, a legal guardian, or an adult designated by a relevant State authority must consent in writing for an adolescent to participate in MAT (42 CFR, Part 8 ß 12(e)(2)). Patients younger than 18 should receive age-appropriate treatments, ideally with a separate treatment track (e.g., young adult groups). 
Cases of uncertainty
When absence of a treatment history or withdrawal symptoms creates uncertainty about an applicantís eligibility, OTP staff should ask the applicant for other means of verification, such as criminal records involving use or possession of opioids or knowledge of such use by a probation or parole officer. A notarized statement from a family or clergy member who can attest to an individualís opioid abuse might be feasible. 
The consensus panel does not recommend use of a naloxone (NarcanÆ) challenge test (see chapter 5) in cases of uncertainty. Physical dependence on opioids can be demonstrated by less drastic measures. For example, a patient can be observed for the effects of withdrawal after he or she has not used a short-acting opioid for 6 to 8 hours. Administering a low dose of methadone and then observing the patient also is appropriate. Administering naloxone, although effective, can initiate severe withdrawal, which the consensus panel believes is unnecessary. It also requires invasive injection, and the effects can disrupt or jeopardize prospects for a sound therapeutic relationship with the patient. The panel recommends that naloxone be reserved to treat opioid overdose emergencies.
History and Extent of Nonopioid Substance Use and Treatm ent
The extent and level of alcohol and nonopioid drug use and treatment also should be determined, and decisions should be made about whether these disorders can be managed safely during MAT (see ìSubstance Use Assessmentî below and chapter 11). 
Medical History
A complete medical history should include organ system diagnoses and treatments and family and psychosocial histories. It should cover chronic or acute medical conditions such as diabetes, liver or renal diseases, sickle cell trait or anemia, and chronic pulmonary disease. Documentation of infectious diseases, including hepatitis, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), is especially important. Staff should note patientsí susceptibility to vaccinepreventable illnesses and any allergies and treatments or medications received for other medical conditions. Womenís medical histories also should document previous pregnancies; types of delivery; complications; current pregnancy status and involvement with prenatal care; alcohol and drug use, including over-thecounter medications, caffeine, and nicotine, before and during any pregnancies; and incidences of sudden infant death syndrome.
Com plete Physical Exam ination
Each patient must undergo a complete, fully documented physical examination by the program physician, a primary care physician, or an authorized health care professional under the direct supervision of the program physician, before admission to the OTP. The full medical examination, including the results of the serology and other tests, must be documented in the patientís record within 14 days following admission. States may have additional requirements, and OTPs must comply with these requirements. The examination should cover major organ systems and the patientís overall health status and should document indications of infectious diseases; pulmonary, liver, and cardiac abnormalities; dermatologic sequelae of addiction; vital signs; general appearance of head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, chest, abdomen, extremities, and skin; and physical evidence of injection drug use and dependence, as well as the physicianís clinical judgment of the extent of physical dependence. Women should receive a pregnancy test and a gynecological examination at the OTP site or by referral to a womenís health center. Again, the results of all tests, laboratory work, and other processes related to the initial medical examination are to be contained in the patientís file within 14 days following admission.
Laboratory Tests
Although Federal regulations no longer require OTPs to conduct a full panel of laboratory tests, some States do. The consensus panel recommends that laboratory tests include routine tests for syphilis, hepatitis, TB, and recent drug use. SAMHSA regulations stipulate ìat least eight random drug abuse testsî annually per patient, performed according to accepted OTP practice (CFR 42, Part 8 ß 12(f)(6)). Given that some drugs are metabolized extensively and excreted quickly, it is important that analytic procedures provide the highest sensitivity for substances of interest, such as breath testing for alcohol use.
TB testing
The risk of TB infection and disease is high among individuals involved with drugs (Batki et al. 2002). Rates of active TB among people who use substances and are HIV infected are high (Gourevitch et al. 1999), and cases of multidrug-resistant TB in this group are increasing. All patients should undergo screening and medical examination for TB every 12 months. Anergy panel tests should be administered to anergic patients (those with diminished reactivity to certain antigens). Patients who are immune system compromised might have a negative purified protein derivative test, even with active infection. A chest x ray or sputum analysis should be done if there is doubt. If a patient has a positive TB test, medical staff should treat the patient accordingly (see chapter 10) or refer him or her to a primary care clinic for treatment.
Hepatitis testing
[R]esults of...the medical examina-
tion are to beÖin the patientís file
within 14 days following admission.
People who inject drugs are at high risk for hepatitis virus infection (see chapter 10) and should be tested at admission to an OTP. Hepatitis A is an important liver infection that affects people who abuse drugs at higher rates than people who do not. Most patients in OTPs are seropositive for surface antigen or antibody to hepatitis B virus (HBV) core antigen, and some exhibit signs of chronic hepatitis. Any patients whose tests are negative for hepatitis A virus or HBV infection should be vaccinated for these infections at the OTP or by referral.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) accounts for most new hepatitis cases among people who inject drugs, infects between 70 and 96 percent of this population, and is the countryís leading cause of chronic liver disease (Sylvestre 2002b). The consensus panel strongly recommends that HCV diagnosis and referral be an integral component of initial MAT assessment. Programs that do not offer onsite HCV antibody testing should provide appropriate referrals. (A simple blood test for hepatitis C antibodies is available; a positive result does not necessarily signal current infections, only that antibodies have developed.)
HIV testing
Clinical examination and an 
applicantís medical history are
keys to determine the appropriateness of MAT.
OTPs are required to provide adequate medical services, and the program sponsor must be able to document that these services are fully and reasonably available to patients. HIV testing on site or by referral, with pretest and posttest counseling, is a recommended medical service. OTPs should make HIV testing part of their medical services as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2001a). Medical care and other supportive services can
be offered if patientsí HIV and HCV statuses are known early in treatment and monitored continuously.
Rapid HIV tests have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service to facilitate early diagnosis of HIV infection among at-risk populations involved in substance abuse (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2002a). Rapid tests can detect antibodies to HIV in blood obtained by fingerstick or venipuncture, or in oral fluid and provide reliable and valid results in 20 minutes or less. Thus, the rapid HIV test provides a measure of exposure to HIV and requires confirmatory testing for a diagnosis of HIV infection. In studies by the manufacturer, the blood antibody test correctly identified 99.6 percent of people infected with HIV and 100 percent of those not infected, which is comparable to the results of FDA-approved enzyme immunoassays. FDA expects clinical laboratories to obtain similar results (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2003b). OTPs performing rapid
HIV tests should comply with the guidelines provided in SAMHSAís Rapid HIV Testing Initiative (www. samhsa.gov/HIVHep/ rhti_factsheet.aspx). As a preliminary positive test, positive results should be confirmed by supplemental HIV testing. In addition, some States have other requirements for laboratory testing in general and HIV testing specifically.
STD testing
Early testing for STDs in patients receiving MAT usually is a State health requirement.
Persons who inject drugs are at higher risk of STDs, primarily from increased likelihood of involvement in sex trading to finance drug use and the disinhibiting effects of psychoactive substances (Sullivan and Fiellin 2004). Therefore, all patients in MAT should receive serologic screening for syphilis and, for women and symptomatic men, genital cultures for gonorrhea and chlamydia (Sullivan and Fiellin 2004). In the early stages of admission and treatment, patients should be educated about the effects of STDs and their correlation with other communicable diseases, such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C, to increase patientsí knowledge of the ways they can avoid these risks. 
For many patients who are opioid addicted, sexual activities are intertwined with drug use behaviors (Calsyn et al. 2000b). Documenting the sexual histories of heterosexual and lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) patients, in terms of timing of sexual encounters and partners, is essential to determine their potential exposure to HCV, HIV, and other STDs, as well as the risk of infection for other sexual partners. Several studies have pointed to increased highrisk sexual behavior among populations that are substance addicted, homeless, and mentally ill, in addition to higher levels of psychological distress and psychiatric symptoms (McKinnon et al. 2002; Stoskopf et al. 2001).
A dditional drug testing
After initial drug testing, subsequent assessment should include further review of urine, blood, oral fluid, or other drug test results. Ideally, drug tests should be conducted regularly and randomly during treatment. The first test is especially important because it is part of the initial evaluation and may serve as documentation of current opioid use. As noted in Federal regulations, the presence of opioids in test results does not establish a diagnosis of opioid addiction, and the absence of opioids does not rule it out. Clinical examination and an applicantís medical history are keys to determine the appropriateness of MAT. Chapter 9 discusses drug-testing procedures and Federal regulations governing these procedures.
Wom enís Health
Women in MAT should receive information on their particular health needs, for example, family planning, gynecological health, and menopause (see the forthcoming TIP Substance Abuse Treatment: Addressing the Specific Needs of Women [CSAT forthcoming f]). Women of childbearing age should be counseled on pregnancy testing during admission before making decisions about detoxification (42 CFR, Part 8 ß 12(e)(3)). Pregnancy testing, along with onsite access to or referral for family planning services, should be available in all OTPs as part of an overall womenís health initiative (see chapter 13). 
Induction A ssessm ent
Induction is the riskiest stage of MAT (see chapter 5), and proper medical assessment during induction requires an understanding of the pharmacology of treatment medication (see chapter 3). A patient should be assessed at least daily during induction for signs of overmedication or undermedication, and dose adjustments should be made accordingly.
Com prehensive A ssessm ent
Completion of induction marks the beginning of stabilization and maintenance treatment and ongoing, comprehensive medical and psychosocial assessment conducted over multiple sessions. This assessment should include, but not be limited to, patient recollections of and attitudes about previous substance abuse treatment; expectations and motivation for treatment; level of support for a substance-free lifestyle; history of physical or sexual abuse; military or combat history; traumatic life events; and the cultural, religious, and spiritual basis for any values and assumptions that might affect treatment. This information should be included in an integrated summary in which data are interpreted, patientsí strengths and problems are noted, and a treatment plan is developed (see chapter 6) that matches each patient to appropriate services.
Data should be collected in a respectful way, taking into consideration a patientís current level of functioning. Motivational interviewing techniques (Miller and Rollnick 2002) can help engage applicants early. The information collected depends on program policies, procedures, and treatment criteria; State and Federal regulations; and the patientís stability and ability to participate in the process. The psychosocial history can reveal addictionrelated problems in areas that might be overlooked, such as strengths, abilities, aptitudes, and preferences. Most information can be analyzed by using standardized comprehensive assessment instruments tailored to specific populations or programs, such as those described by Dodgen and Shea (2000).
SAMHSA regulations require that patients ìaccepted for treatment at an OTP shall be assessed initially and periodically by qualified personnel to determine the most appropriate combination of services and treatmentî (42 CFR, Part 8 ß 12(f)(4) [Federal Register 66(11):1097]). Treatment plans should be reviewed and updated, initially every 90 days and, after 1 year, biannually or whenever changes affect a patientís treatment outcomes. Ongoing monitoring should ensure that services are received, interventions work, new problems are identified and documented, and services are adjusted as problems are solved. Patientsí views of their progress, as well as the treatment teamís assessment of patientsí responses to treatment, should be documented in the treatment plan.
Patient Motivation and Readiness for Chang e
Patient motivation to engage in MAT is a predictor of early retention (Joe et al. 1998) and is associated with increased participation, positive treatment outcomes, improved social adjustment, and successful treatment referrals (CSAT 1999a).
Starting with initial contact and continuing throughout treatment, assessment should focus on patient motivation for change (CSAT 1999a). OTP staff members help patients move beyond past experiences (e.g., negative relationships with staff, inadequate dosing) by focusing on making a fresh start, letting go of old grievances, and identifying current realities, ambivalence about change, and goals for the future. It often is helpful to enlist recovering patients in motivational enhancement activities. TIP 35, Enhancing Motivation for Change in Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT 1999a), provides extensive information about stages of change, the nature of motivation, and current guidelines for enhancing patient motivation to change.
Substance Use Assessm ent
As discussed previously, a patientís lifetime substance use and treatment history should be documented thoroughly. The following areas should be assessed:
ï Periods of abstinence (e.g., number, duration, circumstances)
ï Circumstances or events leading to relapse ï Effects of substance use on physical, psychological, and emotional functioning
ï Changing patterns of substance use, withdrawal signs and symptoms, and medical sequelae.
Reports of psychiatric symptoms during abstinence help treatment providers differentiate drug withdrawal from mental disorder symptoms and can reveal important clues to effective case management, for example, the need to refer patients for treatment of co-occurring disorders.
Chapter 11 discusses treatment methods and considerations for patients with histories of multiple substance abuse. Most of these patients fall into one of three groups, which should be determined during assessment: those who use multiple substances (1) to experience their psychoactive effects, (2) to self-medicate for clinically evident reasons (e.g., back pain, insomnia, headache, co-occurring disorders), or (3) to compensate for inadequate treatment medication (Leavitt et al. 2000). Multiple substance use should be identified and addressed as soon as possible because of the risk of possible overdose for patients who continue to abuse drugs or alcohol during treatment. Continued substance abuse while in MAT might indicate that another treatment option is more appropriate. A challenge in treating patients who abuse substances for clinically evident reasons is to determine whether the patients are attempting to medicate undiagnosed, misdiagnosed, or undertreated problems. If so, then effectively addressing these related problems may reduce or eliminate continuing drug or alcohol abuse and improve outcomes.
Cultural Assessm ent
A comprehensive assessment should include patientsí values and assumptions; linguistic preferences; attitudes, practices, and beliefs about health and well-being; spirituality and religion; and communication patterns that might originate partly from cultural traditions and heritage (Office of Minority Health 2001). Staff knowledge about diverse groups is important for effective treatment services. Of particular importance are experiences and coping mechanisms related to assimilation and acculturation of groups into mainstream American culture that may affect how they perceive substance abuse and MAT. Gathering pertinent information often must rely on subjective sources (e.g., interviews and questionnaires). Even so, staff members involved in screening and assessment should be cautioned against making value judgments about cultural or ethnic preferences or assumptions about ìaverageî middle-class American values and beliefs. (See the forthcoming TIP Improving Cultural Competence in Substance Abuse Treatment [CSAT forthcoming b].)
A shared staffñpatient cultural identity is attractive to some patients entering treatment. To the extent possible, patient preferences for staff members who share their cultural identity should be honored. Multilingual educational materials and displays of culturally diverse materials in the OTP help patients feel more at ease when English is not their primary language.
Psychosocial Assessm ent
The components and objectives of psychosocial assessment also are applicable to patients in MAT. A psychosocial assessment typically identifies the relevant dynamics of patientsí lives and functioning both before the onset of illness (e.g., depression, anxiety) and currently. It identifies patientsí specific strengths and resources (e.g., employment, supportive family relationships) as a basis for focused, individualized, effective treatment planning. 
History of co-occurring disorders and current mental status
Mental status assessments identify the threshold signs of co-occurring disorders and require familiarity with the components of a mental status examination (i.e., general appearance, behavior, and speech; stream of thought, thought content, and mental capacity; mood and affect; and judgment and insight) as outlined in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text
Revision (American Psychiatric Association 2000). A mental status assessment also should look for perceptual disturbances and cognitive dysfunction.
A psychosocial assessmentÖ
identifies the 
relevant dynamics of patientsí lives and functioning
both before the
onset of illness and currently.
Qualified professionals should train all staff members involved in screening and assessment to recognize signs and symptoms of change in patientsí mental status. This training should be ongoing. After reviewing their observations with the program physician, staff members should refer all patients still suspected of having co-occurring disorders for psychiatric evaluation. This evaluation should identify the types of co-occurring disorders and determine how they affect patientsí comprehension, cognition, and psychomotor functioning. Persistent neuropsychological problems warrant formal testing to diagnose their type and severity and to guide treatment. Consultations by psychologists or physicians should be requested or referrals made for testing. (See chapter 12 for typical methods of psychiatric screening and diagnosis in an OTP.)
Sociodemographic history
Sociodemographic data about an applicant should include employment, educational, legal, military, family, psychiatric, and medical histories, as well as current information, and should be supplemented by documents for identification, such as a driverís license, birth or baptismal certificate, passport, Social Security card, Medicaid card, public assistance card, or identification card from another substance abuse treatment program.
Family and cultural background, relationships, and supports
The effect of substance use on a patientís family cannot be overestimated, and family problems should be expected for most patients entering treatment. The comprehensive assessment should include questions about family relationships and problems, including any history of domestic violence, sexual abuse, and mental disorders (see below). When possible, the assessment should include input from relatives and significant others. Because families with members who abuse substances have problems directly linked to this substance abuse, at least one staff member should be trained in family therapy or in making appropriate referrals for this intervention. 
During assessment, program staff should be sensitive to various family types represented in the patient population. For example, programs treating significant numbers of single parents should consider onsite childcare programs. Structured childcare services also enable OTP staff to observe and assess a patientís family functioning, which can be valuable in treatment planning.
Any counselor or treatment provider who might confront emergencies related to child or spousal abuse should be trained in how to identify and report these problems. TIP 25, Substance Abuse Treatment and Domestic Violence (CSAT 1997b), provides screening, assessment, and response guidance when domestic violence is suspected. TIP 36, Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons With Child Abuse and Neglect Issues (CSAT 2000d), focuses on screening and assessment when patients are suspected of being past victims or perpetrators of child abuse. Staff members should be trained to listen and prepared to hear traumatic stories and handle these situations, for example, by monitoring any intense symptoms and seeking special assistance when necessary (CSAT 2000d). Staff should be able to identify individuals who exhibit certain signs and symptoms associated with abuse (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) and provide or coordinate immediate services to address it (CSAT 1997b, 2000d).
Child abuse. All States require mandatory reporting of child abuse by helping professionals including OTP staffóparticularly Statelicensed physicians, therapists, nurses, and social workers (CSAT 2000d). Most States require that this reporting be immediate and offer toll-free numbers. Most also require that reports include the name and address of a parent or caretaker, the type of abuse or neglect, and the name of the alleged perpetrator. Failure to report indications of abuse that results in injury to a child can lead to criminal charges, a civil suit, or loss of professional licensure. Mandated reporters generally are immune from liability for reports made in good faith that later are found to be erroneous (CSAT 2000d).
Staff members who suspect domestic violence should investigate immediately whether a patientís children have been harmed. Inquiries into possible child abuse can occur only after notice of the limitations of confidentiality in MAT (42 CFR, Part 8 ß 12(g)) has been given to the patient, who must acknowledge receipt of this notice in writing. Patients also must be informed, during orientation and when otherwise applicable, that substance abuse treatment providers are required to notify a childrenís protective services agency if they suspect child abuse or neglect.
Exhibit 4-3
Recommended Procedures for Identifying and
A ddressing Domestic Violence*
ï Look for physical injuries, especially patterns of untreated injuries to the face, neck,
throat, and breasts, which might become apparent during the initial physical examination.
ï Pay attention to other indicators: history of relapse or treatment noncompliance; inconsistent explanations for injuries and evasiveness; complications in pregnancy; possible stressand anxiety-related illnesses and conditions; sad, depressed affect; or talk of suicide. ï Fulfill legal obligations to report suspected child abuse, neglect, and domestic violence.
ï Never discuss a patient without the patientís permission; understand which types of subpoenas and warrants require that records be turned over to authorities.
ï Convey that there is no justification for battering and that substance abuse is no excuse. ï Contact domestic violence experts when battery has been confirmed.
Spousal or partner abuse. Generally, if a patient believes that she or he is in imminent danger from a batterer, the treatment provider should respond to this situation before addressing any others and, if necessary, suspend the screening or assessment interview to do so. Exhibit 4-3 summarizes the steps a treatment provider should follow. He or she should refer a patient to a shelter, legal services, or a domestic violence program if indicated. Providers should be familiar with relevant Federal, State, and local regulations on domestic violence (e.g., the 1994 Violence Against Women Act [visit www.ojp.usdoj.gov/vawo/laws/vawa/vawa.htm]) *State laws may include other requirements.
and the legal resources available (e.g., restraining orders, duty to warn, legal obligation to report threats and past crimes, confidentiality).
Romans and colleagues (2000) identified the following methods for exploring potential domestic violence situations, which can be incorporated into effective assessment tools:
ï Always interview patients in private about domestic violence.
ï Begin with direct, broad questions and move to more specific ones; inquire how disagreements or conflicts are resolved (e.g., ìDo you want to hit [him or her] to make [him or her] see sense?î); ask whether patients have trouble with anger or have done anything when angry that they regret; combine these questions with other types of lifestyle questions.
ï Ask about violence by using concrete examples and specific hypothetical situations rather than vague, conceptual questions.
ï Display information about domestic violence in public (e.g., waiting room) and private (e.g., restroom) locations.
ï Use opportunities during discussions (e.g., comments about marital conflict situations or poor communication with partners) to probe further.
ï Obtain as complete a description as possible of the physical, sexual, and psychological violence perpetrated by or on a patient recently; typically, those who commit domestic violence minimize, deny, or otherwise obscure their acts.
History of physical or sexual abuse
Some patients enter an OTP with a history of physical or sexual abuse, which frequently causes additional psychological distress (Schiff et al. 2002). Information about these types of abuse is important in treatment planning but not always easily accessible using specific assessment tools, especially early in treatment.
Some patients with abuse histories might deny their victimization. Many women are less likely to admit abuse to male counselors. Male staff should know when to request a staff change for counseling about physical or sexual abuse. Patients might not be ready to address the problem, think it is unrelated to substance abuse, or be ashamed. Gathering information from them about abuse, therefore, requires extreme care and respect during screening and assessment. Once patients are stabilized and their practical needs are addressed, counseling by qualified treatment providers can focus on this problem.
Peer relations and support
The extent of social deterioration, interpersonal loss, and isolation that patients have experienced should be documented thoroughly during screening and assessment. Assessment of a patientís support systems, including past participation in mutual-help groups (e.g., Alcoholics Anonymous, Methadone Anonymous [MA]), is critical to identifying peer support networks that provide positive relationships and enhance treatment outcomes. Some 12Step groups are ill-informed about MAT and may be unaware of the treatment goals of MAT
[A]ssessment and treatment... should focus on stopping the 
substance abuse that interferes with patientsí well-being.
and less than supportive; in these cases, providers should help patients identify other sources of support (e.g., MA groups) and encourage continued development of some type of peer support network. In areas with limited resources, patients may be able to overcome initial discriminatory behavior in existing groups by increasing their knowledge of MAT and their ability to self-advocate.
Housing status and safety concerns
Based on year 2000 estimates, approximately 10 percent of patients in MAT are homeless or living as transients when admitted to treatment (Joseph et al. 2000). Moreover, those who are not homeless often live with people who are addicted or in areas where substance use is common. In the opinion of the consensus panel, early intervention to arrange safe, permanent shelter for these patients should be a high priority, and a patientís shelter needs should be ascertained quickly during screening and assessment. OTPs should establish special support services to help patients secure appropriate living arrangements, such as referral agreements with housing agencies or other programs to locate housing that addresses the special needs of homeless patients. 
Criminal history and legal status
Another purpose of screening and assessment is to identify legal issues that might interrupt treatment, such as outstanding criminal charges or ongoing illegal activity to support substance use; however, pending or unresolved charges are not a contraindication for MAT. Assessment may involve exploring personal circumstances such as child custody and related obligations. In the consensus panelís experience, many patients ignore legal problems during periods of substance use, but these problems pose a serious threat to recovery. In addition, a patientís arrest record, including age at first arrest, arrest frequency, nature of offenses, criminal involvement during childhood, and life involvement with the criminal justice system, should be clarified.
Insurance status
Patientsí resources to cover treatment costs should be determined during screening and assessment. Often they are uninsured or have not explored their eligibility for payment assistance. The consensus panel believes that OTPs are responsible for helping patients explore payment options so that they have access to a full range of treatment services, including medical care, while ensuring payment to the OTP.
In situations of inadequate funding or patient ineligibility for funds, another source of payment should be identified. OTP staff can assist patients in applying for public assistance or inquiring whether personal insurance will reimburse MAT costs. Counselors can help patients make decisions about involving their insurance companies and address fears that employers will find out about their substance use or that benefits for health care will be denied.
Employment history
Another important component of psychosocial assessment is a patientís employment history. Based on year 2000 estimates, only 20 percent of patients in MAT were employed when admitted to an OTP (Joseph et al. 2000). Until they are stabilized, employed patients often experience substance-related difficulties at the workplace, including lack of concentration, tardiness and absences, inability to get along with coworkers, on-the-job accidents, and increased claims for workersí compensation. Early identification of these difficulties can help staff and patients create a more effective treatment plan. 
Patients who are employed often are reluctant to enter residential treatment or take the time to become stabilized on medication; however, most of these patients would take medical or other leave time if they were hospitalized for other illnesses, and they should be encouraged to take their addiction as seriously. A physicianís note recommending time off work for some period might help, but it should be on letterhead that does not reference drug treatment.
Military or other service history
A patientís military or other service history can highlight valuable areas in treatment planning. In particular, was military service generally a positive or negative experience? If the former, treatment providers can help patients identify areas of strength or personal achievement, such as the ability to cope under stress, receipt of medals for service accomplishments, and honorable discharge; patients can learn to build on past strengths in current challenging situations and to progress in treatment. If the latter, providers should review patientsí negative military experiences, including loss of friends and loved ones, onset of substance use, war-related injuries, chronic pain, PTSD, and co-occurring disorders (e.g., depression). This information might indicate patterns of behavior that continue to affect recovery.
Patientsí military history also might reveal their eligibility for medical and treatment resources through U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs programs and hospitals or social service agencies.
Spirituality
ìSpiritualityî in this TIP refers to willing involvement in socially desirable activities or processes that are beyond the immediate details of daily life and personal self-interest. Attention to the ethics of behavior, consideration for the interests of others, community involvement, helping others, and participating in organized religion are expressions of spirituality.
A patientís spirituality can be an important treatment resource, and persons recovering from addiction often experience increased interest in the spiritual aspects of their lives. A study by Flynn and colleagues (2003) of 432 patients admitted to 18 OTPs found that those who remained in recovery for 5 years credited religion or spirituality as one factor in this outcome. Staff should assess patientsí connections with religious institutions because these institutions often provide a sense of belonging that is valuable in the rehabilitative process. 
Miller (1998) found a lack of research exploring the association between spirituality and addiction recovery but concluded that spiritual engagement or reengagement appeared to be correlated with recovery. In studies reviewed by Muffler and colleagues (1992), individuals with a high degree of spiritual motivation to recover reported that treatment programs that included spiritual guidance or counseling were more likely to produce positive outcomes than programs that did not. OTPs should assess spiritual resources adequately. Counselors and other mental health professionals could benefit from training in patient spirituality if it is difficult for them to explore.
Sexual orientation and history
The assessment and treatment needs of heterosexual and LGB populations are similar and should focus on stopping the substance abuse that interferes with patientsí well-being. Assessment of risk factors associated with sexual encounters and partners is essential. What often differs for an LGB population is the importance of assessing patientsí sexual or gender orientation concerns, such as their feelings about their sexual orientation (CSAT 2001b). OTP staff should pay strict attention to confidentiality concerns for LGB patients because they may be at increased risk of legal or other actions affecting employment, housing, or child custody. Treatment modalities and programs should be accessible to all groups, and programs providing ancillary services should be sensitive to the special needs of all patients regardless of sexual orientation (CSAT 2001b).
Patientsí ability to manage money
Financial difficulties are common among patients in MAT, who often have spent considerable money on their substance use that otherwise would have paid for rent, food, and utilities. Financial status and money management skills should be assessed to help patients understand their fiscal strengths and weaknesses as they become stabilized. Patients often need assistance to adjust to loss of income caused by reduced criminal activity and develop skills that enhance their legitimate earning power. Once financial factors are clarified, patients may be better prepared to devise realistic strategies to achieve short- and longterm goals.
Recreational and leisure activities
Recreational and leisure activities are important in recovery; therefore, assessment should determine any positive activities in which patients have participated before or during periods of substance use. Identifying existing recreational and leisure time preferences and gaining exposure to new ones can be significant steps in developing a recovery-oriented lifestyle.

Treatment procedures have been explained to me, and I understand that this will involve my taking the prescribed opioid drug at the schedule determined by the program physician, or his/her designee, in accordance with Federal and State regulations.
It has been explained that, like all other prescription medications, opioid treatment medications can be harmful if not taken as prescribed. I further understand that opioid treatment medications produce dependence and, like most other medications, may produce side effects. Possible side effects, as well as alternative treatments and their risks and benefits, have been explained to me.
I understand that it is important for me to inform any medical provider who may treat me for any medical problem that I am enrolled in an opioid treatment program so that the provider is aware of all the medications I am taking, can provide the best possible care, and can avoid prescribing medications that might affect my opioid pharmacotherapy or my chances of successful recovery from addiction.
I understand that I may withdraw voluntarily from this treatment program and discontinue the use of the medications prescribed at any time. Should I choose this option, I understand I will be offered medically supervised tapering.
For Female Patients of Childbearing Age: There is no evidence that methadone pharmacotherapy is harmful during pregnancy. If I am or become pregnant, I understand that I should tell my medical provider right away so that I can receive appropriate care and referrals. I understand that there are ways to maximize the healthy course of my pregnancy while I am in opioid pharmacotherapy.

Office-Based Opioid Therapy

This chapter describes pharmacotherapy in opioid treatment programs (OTPs), in particular the clinical use of methadone, with limited discussion of levo-alpha acetyl methadol (LAAM) and buprenorphine. More limited coverage is provided on the opioid antagonist naltrexone, which is not used widely for opioid addiction treatment in the United States. As explained in chapter 3, at this writing most OTPs have discontinued the use of LAAM for new patients, and its continued availability is uncertain. TIP 40, Clinical Guidelines for the Use of Buprenorphine in the Treatment of Opioid Addiction (CSAT 2004a), provides more detailed information about buprenorphine.
In general, the choice of medication used in medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction (MAT) is based on safety and efficacy, patient preferences, and treatment goals. Methadone maintenance treatment has the longest successful track record in patients addicted to opioids for more than a year and has been shown to control withdrawal symptoms, stabilize physiologic processes, and improve functionality. Studies also have found that methadone maintenance treatment reduces criminality, noncompliance with HIV/AIDS therapy, seroconversion to HIV/AIDS, and mortality associated with opioid addiction (Appel et al. 2001; Ball and Ross 1991). Since 2001, LAAM, although effective in opioid pharmacotherapy, has carried a restrictive label precluding its use as the initial medication for MAT. As reviewed in chapter 3, the effectiveness of buprenorphine has been found to be similar to that of methadone and LAAM (Johnson et al. 2000). Sublingual buprenorphine formulations have been approved for use in OTPs and by physicians in office-based and other health care settings. Some patients prefer buprenorphine maintenance in an office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) setting to the daily observed dosing that is part of methadone maintenance in an OTP. However, patients who progress in MAT while in an OTP eventually may qualify for take-home medication lasting up to 30 days at a time, as detailed below, and patients desiring ongoing buprenorphine pharmacotherapy now can receive buprenorphine on a less-than-daily basis in either an OTP or OBOT setting. For some patients, these options may reduce the attendance requirements for MAT in an OTP.

For patients who do not qualify for or do not prefer opioid maintenance treatment (see ìContraindications to Opioid Pharmacotherapyî below), a primary issue during treatment is what to do about withdrawal symptoms. Naturally occurring opioid withdrawal is almost never life threatening, but it can produce discomfort severe enough to warrant urgent intervention. Treatment for withdrawal symptoms usually involves administration of a long-acting opioid medication such as methadone or buprenorphine, which can be followed by gradual tapering of the medication as withdrawal symptoms diminish.
Control of withdrawal symptoms often is insufficient treatment to prevent a relapse to opioid abuse, and detoxification alone may yield only short-term benefits. Research has shown that retention in treatment over an extended period is key to successful outcomes for opioid addiction in many patients, just as it is for other chronic diseases like hypertension, diabetes, and asthma (McLellan et al. 2000). Therefore, when detoxification from short-acting opioids is provided, the consensus panel recommends linkage to ongoing psychosocial treatment, with or without additional maintenance therapy with an opioid antagonist such as naltrexone. Comprehensive, long-term opioid agonist maintenance remains the treatment with the best track record of controlling opioid use and saving lives, although opioid partial agonist therapy is promising. Access and easy transfer to this care should remain available as part of any detoxification program.
Contraindications to Opioid
Pharm acotherapy
The consensus panel believes that few psychiatric or medical diagnoses categorically should rule out admission to an OTP or access to opioid pharmacotherapy. Inclusion rather than exclusion should be the guiding principle. Types of people who possibly should not be admitted to an OTP and should receive other interventions include
ï Individuals who abuse opioids but whose conditions do not meet criteria for opioid dependence outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (American Psychiatric Association 2000). If a clear history of opioid abuse or addiction exists but a person currently is not addicted, regulations allow admission to an OTP in two cases in which a person might relapse without treatment: pregnancy and release from incarceration (42 Code of Federal Regulation [CFR], 8 Part ß 12(e)(3)).
ï Individuals with less than 1 year of opioid
addiction and no addiction treatment history, except patients receiving OBOT with buprenorphine. Detoxification might be attempted with applicants who have a shorter history of addiction. Applicants receiving buprenorphine may be admitted to an OTP for either medically supervised withdrawal or maintenance treatment.
ï Applicants who cannot attend treatment sessions regularly, especially for medication dosing (unless a clinical exception can be obtained [see chapter 7]); this requirement is less of a hindrance for patients receiving OBOT with buprenorphine.
ï Previous patients who have had allergic reactions to methadone, LAAM, or buprenorphine.
ï For LAAM, applicants with cardiac abnormalities such as prolonged QT interval.
In addition, people who are opioid addicted and meet DSM-IV-TR criteria for alcohol or sedative dependence might be problematic candidates for opioid pharmacotherapy because the combined effects of alcohol or sedatives that depress the central nervous system (CNS) can cause serious adverse events during MAT (see discussion of drug interactions in chapter 3). Some treatment providers require detoxification from alcohol and sedatives before opioid pharmacotherapy, followed by careful monitoring such as daily BreathalyzerJ tests, ongoing drug tests, and reduction or withholding of medication if a test is positive. The consensus panel endorses this strategy, provided that adequate alcohol or sedative detoxification facilities are readily available. If not, both opioid addiction and alcohol or sedative dependence should be treated concurrently at the OTP site with a combination of psychosocial and pharmacological interventions.
Stag es of Pharm acotherapy
The stages of pharmacotherapy with methadone, LAAM, or buprenorphine include induction, stabilization, and maintenance. The stages of naltrexone pharmacotherapy may differ.
Induction
Induction procedures for methadone, LAAM, and buprenorphine depend on the unique pharmacologic properties of each medication, prevailing regulatory requirements, and patient characteristics. Regardless of the medication used, safety is key during the induction stage. 
General considerations
Timing. When to begin the first dose of opioid treatment medication is important. Most treatment providers begin treating new patients when there are no signs of opioid intoxication or sedation and some beginning signs of opioid withdrawal. Administration of the first dose also should await a physical assessment to rule out any acute, life-threatening condition that opioids might mask or worsen (see chapter 4 for more information on medical assessment). For naltrexone, patients should be abstinent from all short-acting opioids for at least 7 days and from long-acting opioids, such as methadone, for at least 10 days before beginning the medication to prevent potentially severe withdrawal symptoms (OíConnor and Fiellin 2000).
Other substance use. The presence of sedatives such as benzodiazepines or alcohol should be ruled out before induction to minimize the likelihood of oversedation with the first dose. OTP staff should ensure that patients known to abuse sedatives, tranquilizers, tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, alcohol, or other CNS depressants are told in clear language of the dangers of adverse effects if they take these substances while being stabilized or maintained on methadone, LAAM, or buprenorphine.
Regardless of the medication used, safety is key during the induction stage.
Observed dosing. Observed dosing with methadone, LAAM, or buprenorphine should be part of the medical safety procedure and diversion control plan in an OTP and is recommended during induction with buprenorphine. Observed dosing is the only way to ensure that a patient ingests a given dose and to monitor a patientís response. In observed dosing, staff members who dispense medication first carefully identify patientsó sometimes by requiring them to remove hats or dark glasses, for exampleóand then provide the medication.
To ensure that patients swallow oral doses of methadone or LAAM, they should be required to speak before and after ingesting at least 2 ounces of liquid in which an appropriate dose of medication is dissolved. For buprenorphine, a sublingual tablet should be observed to have dissolved completely under the tongue. After the first dose, patients should wait in an observation area and be checked 30 to 60 minutes later for acute adverse effects. If same-day dosing adjustments must be made, patients should wait 2 to 4 more hours after the additional dosing, for further evaluation when peak effects are achieved. The consensus panel recommends that patients be observed for several hours after the first dose of any opioid treatment medication. This observation is particularly important for patients at higher risk of overdose, including those naive to methadone, LAAM, and buprenorphine; those receiving other CNS-depressant medications or known to abuse CNS depressants; and severely medically ill, frail, or elderly patients. Naltrexone typically is prescribed without observed dosing, but poor patient compliance with ongoing naltrexone therapy has led some investigators to look at using family members to ensure that patients take their medication (Fals-Stewart and OíFarrell 2003).
[T]he safety principle ìstart
low and go slowî
applies for early medication
dosages in an outpatient OTP.
Initial dosing. The first dose of any opioid treatment medication should be lower if a patientís opioid tolerance is believed to be low, the history of opioid use is uncertain, or no signs of opioid withdrawal are evident. Some former patients who have been released from incarceration or are pregnant and are being readmitted because they have a history of addiction might have lost their tolerance. Loss of tolerance should be considered for any patient who has abstained from opioids for more than 5 days. In general, the safety principle ìstart low and go slowî applies for early medication dosages in an outpatient OTP. The amount of opioid abuse estimated by patients usually gives only a rough idea of their tolerance and should not be used as a dosing guide for induction, nor should initial dosages be determined by previous treatment episodes or patient estimates of dollars spent per day on opioids. Patients transferred from other treatment programs should start with medication dosages identical to those prescribed at their previous OTPs.
Dosage adjustments in the first week of treatment should be based on how
patients feel at the peak period for their medication (e.g., 2 to 4 hours after a dose of methadone is administered), not on how long the effects of a medication last. As stores of medication accumulate in body tissues (see below), the effects begin to last longer.
Steady state. Initial dosing should be followed by dosage increases over subsequent days until withdrawal symptoms are suppressed at the peak of action for the medication. Methadone, LAAM, and buprenorphine are stored in body tissues, including the liver, from which their slow release keeps blood levels of medication steady between doses. It is important for physicians, staff members, and patients to understand that doses of medication are eliminated more quickly from the bloodstream and medication effects wear off sooner than might be expected until sufficient levels are attained in tissues. During induction, even without dosage increases, each successive dose adds to what is present already in tissues until steady state is reached. Steady state refers to the condition in which the level of medication in a patientís blood remains fairly steady because that drugís rate of intake equals the rate of its breakdown and excretion.
Steady state is based on multiples of the elimination half-life. Approximately four to five half-life times are needed to establish a steady state for most drugs. For example, because methadone has a half-life of 24 to 36 hours, its steady stateóthe time at which a relatively constant blood level should remain present in the bodyóis achieved in 5 to 7.5 days after dosage change for most patients. However, individuals may differ significantly in how long it takes to achieve steady state.
Patients should stay on a given dosage for a reasonable period before deciding how it will ìhold.î During induction, patients should be instructed to judge their doses by how they feel during the peak period (the point of maximum concentration of medication in the blood [for methadone, 2 to 4 hours after taking a dose]), rather than during the trough period (the low point of medication concentration in blood just before the next dose [for methadone, approximately 24 hours after ingestion]). Patients who wake up sick during the first few days of opioid pharmacotherapy might become convinced that they need a dose increase, when in fact they need more time for tissue stores to reach steady state. In contrast, patients who wake up sick after the first week of treatmentówhen tissue stores have reached steady-state levelsómight indeed need higher doses.
In closely monitored settings such as inpatient programs, multiple split doses can be administered per day based on patientsí symptoms at peak blood levels. Outpatient programs are limited in this approach because patients can be monitored only when they are at the OTP site. (Split dosing is discussed further below.) Because buprenorphineís safety profile makes overdose less of a concern, some providers opt to give even new patients receiving buprenorphine some take-home medication for multiple dosing during induction (CSAT 2004a).
Induction w ith methadone and LA A M
Because methadone overdose deaths have occurred in the first few days of treatment (Caplehorn and Drummer 1999; Zador and Sunjic 2000), it is important to adjust methadone dosage carefully until stabilization and tolerance are established. Federal regulations require that methadone initially be given daily under observation for either 6 or 7 days per week. (A take-home dose is allowed for all patients when the OTP is closed on Sunday.) LAAM must continue to be given under observation and administered no more than every 2 to 3 days.
Initial dosing. For a patient actively abusing opioids, a typical first dose of methadone is 20 to 30 mg (Joseph et al. 2000) and is limited by regulations to no more than 30 mg. If withdrawal symptoms persist after 2 to 4 hours, the initial dose can be supplemented with another 5 to 10 mg (Joseph et al. 2000). The total firstday dose of methadone allowed by Federal regulations is 40 mg unless a program physician documents in the patient record that 40 mg was insufficient to suppress opioid withdrawal symptoms (42 CFR, Part 8 ß 12(h)(3)(ii)).
Since 2001, LAAM has carried a restriction that precludes its use as an initial medication for pharmacotherapy because of concerns about its cardiovascular effects. Although direct induction with LAAM can be accomplished with an initial dose of 20 to 40 mg every 48 hours, LAAM has been used almost exclusively in cases involving transfer of patients from methadone maintenance. LAAM must never be given on 2 consecutive days because its extended duration of action can result in toxic blood levels leading to fatal overdose.
Variations in individual response and optimal dosing. Most differences in patient response to methadone can be explained by variations in individual rates of absorption, digestion, and excretion of the drug, which in turn are caused by such factors as body weight and size, other substance use, diet, co-occurring disorders and medical diseases, and genetic factors. Because variation in response to methadone is considerable, the consensus panel believes that the notion of a uniformly suitable dosage range or an upper dosage limit for all patients is unsupported scientifically. Whereas 60 mg of methadone per day may be adequate for some patients, it has been reported that some patients require much more for optimal effect. Treatment providers should avoid thinking of ìhigh dosageî as being above a certain uniform threshold; however, there are few data on the safety of methadone doses above 120 mg/day. For example, diversion of very high doses can be associated with significant risk because the tolerance of the person taking the diverted dose may be insufficient to avoid overdose.
The way a person presents at the OTP is often the best indicator for determining optimal dosage. Looking for clinical signs and listening to patient-reported symptoms related to daily doses or changes in dosage can lead to adjustments and more favorable outcomes (Leavitt et al. 2000). Exhibit 5-1 illustrates the use of signs and symptoms to determine optimal methadone dosages. Generally, the disappearance of opioid withdrawal symptoms indicates adequate dosing and serum methadone levels (SMLs) within the therapeutic comfort zone.
Research indicates that patients diagnosed with mental disorders or hepatitis C along with substance addiction may need increases of 50 percent or more in methadone dosage to achieve stabilization (Leavitt et al. 2000; Maxwell and Shinderman 2002).
Exhibit 5-2 illustrates how blood levels of methadone rise with repeated dosing until steady state is reached. It is important to understand that steady state is achieved after a dosage change. In Exhibit 5-2, because the last change (to 100 mg) occurred on day 5, steady state was not achieved until approximately day 10.
Induction w ith buprenorphine
Because buprenorphine has lower abuse potential than methadone or LAAM and is less likely to produce respiratory depression if diverted or misused, qualified practitioners can prescribe buprenorphine without the control structure of an OTP when they meet Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 requirements. No stated requirement exists for observed dosing with buprenorphine, although guidelines strongly recommend dosage monitoring early in treatment (CSAT 2004a).
Initial dosing. Awaiting signs of withdrawal before administering the first dose is especially important for buprenorphine induction because, as explained in chapter 3, buprenorphine can precipitate withdrawal in some circumstances (Johnson and Strain 1999). Precipitated withdrawal usually is more sudden and can be more severe and uncomfortable than naturally occurring withdrawal. The typical first dose of buprenorphine is 4 mg. If withdrawal symptoms persist after 2 to 4 hours, the initial dose can be supplemented with up to 4 mg for a maximum dose of 8 mg of buprenorphine on the first day (Johnson et al. 2003b).
Three national evaluations of the buprenorphine-naloxone combination tablet found that direct induction with buprenorphine alone was effective for most people who were opioid addicted. However, buprenorphine tablets without naloxone (sometimes called monotherapy tablets) are recommended during the first 2 days of induction for patients attempting to transfer from a longer acting opioid such as sustained-release morphine or methadone (Amass et al. 2000, 2001) because most of these patients will experience withdrawal effects from the naloxone in the combination tablets. When patientsí tissue levels of a full agonist are a factor and the buprenorphine-naloxone tablet is administered, it may be difficult to determine whether precipitated withdrawal is caused by the partial agonist buprenorphine or small amounts of absorbed naloxone.
For most patients who are appropriate candidates for induction with the combination tablet, the initial target dose after induction should be 12 to 16 mg of buprenorphine in 
a 4-to-1 ratio to naloxone (i.e., 12/3 to 16/4 mg [buprenorphine/naloxone]). Bringing patients to this target dosage may be achieved over the first 3 days of treatment by doubling the dose each successive day after initial administration. An initial dose of 4/1 mg (buprenorphine/ naloxone) is recommended, followed in 2 to 4 hours with an additional 4/1 mg if indicated. The dosage should be increased on subsequent days to the target dosage (ranging from 12/3 to 16/4 mg per day). During dose induction, patients may need to visit their OTP or physicianís office daily for dose adjustments and clinical monitoring. Further information and guidelines for buprenorphine induction and use can be found in TIP 40, Clinical Guidelines for the Use of Buprenorphine in the Treatment of Opioid Addiction (CSAT 2004a).
Induction w ith naltrexone
The standard procedure for induction to naltrexone therapy is first to make certain that there is an absence of physiological dependence on opioids. This often is done by using a Narcan challenge after a 7- to 10-day period during which opioids are not used. Then the patient is given 25 mg of naltrexone initially, followed by 50 mg the next day if no withdrawal symptoms occur after the first 25 mg dose. Thereafter, the patient is given 50 mg per day or up to 350 mg per week in three doses during the week. The first dose usually is smaller to minimize naltrexoneís side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, and to ensure that patients have been abstinent from opioids for the requisite time (Stine et al. 2003).
Stabilization
The terms ìsteady stateî and ìstabilizationî should be differentiated. Steady state is achieved when a treatment medication is eliminated from the blood at the exact rate that more is added. In contrast, a patient is stabilized when he or she no longer exhibits drugseeking behavior or craving. The correct (steady-state) medication dosage contributes to a patientís stabilization, but it is only one of several factors, as discussed elsewhere in this TIP. The stabilization stage of opioid pharmacotherapy focuses on finding the right dosage for each patient. The potential for undermedication or overmedication can be avoided by a flexible approach to dosing, which sometimes requires higher dosages of treatment medication than expected, and by taking into account patient-reported symptoms (Leavitt et al. 2000).
Dosage determination
It is critical to successful patient management in MAT to determine a medication dosage that will minimize withdrawal symptoms and craving and decrease or eliminate opioid abuse. Dosage requirements for methadone, LAAM, and buprenorphine must be determined on an individual basis. There is no single recommended dosage or even a fixed range of dosages for all patients. For many patients, the therapeutic dosage range of methadone may be in the neighborhood of 80 to 120 mg per day (Joseph et al. 2000), but it can be much higher, and occasionally it is much lower.
The desired responses to medication that usually reflect optimal dosage include (Joseph et al. 2000)
ï Prevention of opioid withdrawal for 24 hours
or longer, including both early subjective symptoms and objective signs typical of abstinence
ï Elimination of drug hunger or craving ï Blockade of euphoric effects of self-
administered opioids (This is not a true blockade like that achieved by naltrexone but reflects cross-tolerance for other opioids, attenuating or eliminating desired sensations when illicit or prescription opioids are selfadministered in usual ìstreet doses.î The increasing purity of heroin and availability of highly potent prescription opioids have made it increasingly difficult to achieve complete blockade in patients through cross-tolerance; consequently, some patients require dosages considerably greater than 120 mg per day to achieve this effect.)
ï Tolerance for the sedative effects of treatment medication, creating a state in which patients can function normally without impairment of perception or physical or emotional response
ï Tolerance for most analgesic effects produced by treatment medication (see ìPain Managementî in chapter 10).
Unfortunately, no exact way exists to determine optimal dosage for each patient. However, the consensus panel recommends that OTPs avoid exclusive reliance on drug test results and preconceived notions of correct dosage; instead, OTPs should determine dosage based primarily on patient response. Even when a medication dosage is controlled for body weight (Leavitt et al. 2000), patient responses, such as absence of withdrawal symptoms without oversedation and remission from illicit-opioid use, are the best indicators of appropriate dosage. In addition, the extent of other drug use and alcohol consumption should be considered when determining dosage adequacy. Finally, a patientís complaints (or lack thereof) are also important indicators of dosage adequacy. A patient can experience opioid craving or withdrawal but manage to abstain from illicit opioids. 
Methadone. Strong evidence supports the use of daily methadone doses in the range of 80 mg or more for most patients (Strain et al. 1999), but considerable variability exists in patient responses. Some do well on dosages below 80 to 120 mg per day, and others require significantly higher dosages (Joseph et al. 2000). OTPs should exercise additional caution with higher dosages, guarding against diversion of takehome methadone to individuals who are opioid intolerant because higher dosages can be lethal for such individuals.
Buprenorphine. Buprenorphine dosage should be determined in a manner similar to that used for methadone or LAAM. The recommended dosage of buprenorphine to begin stabilization is 12 to 16 mg per day for most patients, with increases provided thereafter as applicable (Johnson et al. 2003b). As reviewed by Johnson and colleagues (2003b), if patients continue to show evidence of opioid abuse or withdrawal, the dosage should be increased using the same types of guidelines as for methadone. For example, if the goal is to suppress opioid withdrawal symptoms, then dose increases can be less frequent (e.g., weekly or biweekly) because the desired therapeutic response likely will become detectable more slowly.
Dosage requirements for
methadone,
LAAM, and buprenorphine must be deter-
mined on an individual basis.
Most patients are likely to remain stable on 12 to 24 mg per day, although some might need dosages of up to 32 mg per day. Increasing the buprenorphine dosage to 24 mg per day or higher has been shown to prolong the duration of its effects and usually is necessary if patients are to be dosed every other day, which is an option with buprenorphine; however, such an increase usually does not increase buprenorphineís opioid agonist effects to the same degree because of its partial agonist properties (Johnson et al. 2003b). Because buprenorphine is a partial agonist, patients who continue to abuse opioids after sufficient exposure to buprenorphine treatment and ancillary psychosocial services or who experience continued symptoms of withdrawal at optimal daily doses of buprenorphine (12 to 32 mg) should be considered for therapy with methadone or LAAM (CSAT 2004a; Johnson et al. 2003b).
As with all medications used for MAT, when buprenorphine dosage changes are contemplated, the intensity and frequency of other available psychosocial services (see chapter 8) affect patientsí ability to refrain from opioid abuse
(Bickel et al. 1997) and should be considered.
LAAM. Most patients who begin LAAM are being transferred from methadone and should have been screened for cardiac risk. Equivalency dosing tables for methadone and LAAM are available in the ORLAAMÆpackage insert (Roxane Laboratories, Inc., 2001), and transfer can be done easily. Because of the longacting nature of LAAM, a patientís reaction should be monitored closely during the first 2 weeks of treatment and adjustments in dosage made accordingly.
Patients may request transfer from methadone to LAAM for various reasons: (1) to avoid the hardship of methadoneís daily observed dosing, (2) to provide negative drug test results at work (LAAM is less likely to show up on screening tests), (3) because they are not doing well on methadone (Borg et al. 2002), (4) because LAAM can be less sedating, and (5) because the patients are rapid metabolizers of methadone and would benefit from LAAM because it is longer acting.
LAAM can be given every other day if an OTP is open all week or three times per week (i.e., two 48-hour doses and one 72-hour dose) if that is more convenient. Although some patients take the same dose on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, most benefit from an increase on Friday (i.e., 10 to 40 percent more than the Monday and Wednesday doses) with or without an additional small dose of methadone to be taken home and used on Sunday. For stable patients, the best option is a regular LAAM dose on Friday and a full methadone dose (80 percent of the LAAM dose) as a take-home dose for Sunday. The efficacy of LAAM dosing is determined clinically and by patient history and examination; an affordable means to determine blood levels of LAAM and its metabolites is unavailable at this writing.
Naltrexone. Naltrexone can be administered either daily (usually at a dosage of 50 mg per day) or thrice weekly. For the latter, the usual practice is to give 100 mg on Monday and Wednesday and 150 mg on Friday (Stine et al.
2003).
Studies of the importance of dosing
Much evidence shows a positive correlation between medication dosage during MAT and treatment response (e.g., Strain et al. 1999). Higher dosages in some studies probably produced greater cross-tolerance. Cross-tolerance occurs when medication diminishes or prevents the euphoric effects of heroin or other shortacting opioids so that patients who continue to abuse opioids no longer feel ìhigh.î The medication dosage needed for this result depends on how long and how recently a patient has abused heroin or other opioids and how much he or she has used, along with individual differences in the level of brain receptor adaptation induced by chronic opioid use.
An Australian study connected the importance of dosage with patient retention in MAT (Caplehorn and Bell 1991). The importance of retention for successful treatment outcomes is discussed further in chapter 8. In addition to the benefits of eliminating illicit opioids (see below), reductions in the threats of HIV and hepatitis B and C make adequate dosing and treatment retention high priorities and justify additional studies on the safety and efficacy of methadone doses exceeding 120 mg.
In their classic study, Ball and Ross (1991) clearly demonstrated an inverse relationship between frequency of recent heroin use and methadone dosage. The data in Exhibit 5-3 are based on their study of 407 patients who received methadone maintenance treatment. These data support the premise that lower methadone dosages are less effective than higher or adequate dosages in facilitating abstinence from heroin among patients in MAT. The low end of the effective range has been accepted widely as about 60 mg for most patients (reviewed in Faggiano et al. 2003).
Another study (Maxwell and Shinderman 2002) monitored 144 patients who were not doing well at 100 mg of methadone per day and reported excellent results after raising dosages based on clinical signs and symptoms. Patients receiving more than 200 mg per day (mean 284.9 mg per day) had improved responses with no apparent increase in adverse events. However, additional controlled research is needed to determine the safety of very high doses of methadone or other medications used in MAT.
With the increased availability of blood testing in OTPs, measurements of blood concentrations of methadone at peak and trough are used more commonly as aids to determine individual methadone dosage requirements. A study in England (Wolff et al. 1991) showed a positive correlation between methadone dosages and concentrations in serum (Exhibit 5-4). Moreover, mean SMLs near or above 400 ng/mL are gaining increasing consensus as ideal levels for treatment effectiveness (Payte et al. 2003). Although mean SMLs of 400 ng/mL generally are considered to be sufficient to block the effects of illicit opioids and prevent withdrawal symptoms, some patients may require higher SMLs for stabilization. More research is needed to understand better the relationship between methadone blood levels and cessation of opioid abuse. SML results should continue to be considered along with patient symptoms. For example, a patient with an SML below 400 ng/mL with no symptoms of discomfort would not require a dosage increase, whereas a patient with an SML of 600 ng/mL but with persisting withdrawal symptoms would.
Okruhlica and colleagues (2002) investigated 
69 patients receiving methadone dosages of 10 to 270 mg per day and found a significant positive relationship between dosage and mean SMLs, although, at each dosage level, patientsí resulting SMLs differed widely. Some had relatively low (subtherapeutic) SMLs, even at daily doses considerably above 100 mg, which would be expected to affect treatment negatively (Leavitt et al. 2000). Given these and similar data, it is incorrect to conclude that a particular methadone dosage causes a specific SML; many other factors are likely to affect SMLs for individual patients. However, measuring SMLs can be useful to determine why a relatively high methadone dosage does not appear to benefit a patient. In such cases, a blood test may show that a patientís SML remains low and that he or she requires a higher dose.
In their review, Leavitt and colleagues (2000) noted a broad range of SMLs among patients in MAT. They suggested that individual differences in metabolic enzyme activity and other factors may lead to higher or lower serum levels of the (R)-methadone enantiomer, explaining some of the variation in dosage ranges needed for clinical effectiveness. In one study of the clinical uses of methadone blood level measurements, it was suggested that the peak level should be no more than twice the trough level and that, if it is more, the patient should be considered a ìfast metabolizerî and be administered split dosing. When split dosing is used, patients receive two or three doses per day to achieve the targeted peak-to-trough ratio in blood level measurements and to avoid withdrawal symptoms for 24 hours (Payte et al. 2003). Exhibit 5-5 shows 24-hour SML curves at both inadequate and adequate dosages. These curves include peak SMLs at roughly 4 hours after dose ingestion (0 hour) and trough SMLs at 24 hours after ingestion. Data were derived by averaging a series by Inturrisi and Verebely (1972) and another one by Kreek
(1973). Exhibit 5-6 shows an example of plasma levels in a fast metabolizer, illustrating that when a dayís dose is split into two (lower curve), the peak SML achieved after each of the two split doses is lower than the peak achieved after a single daily dose (upper curve), and the trough SML reached just before the next split dose is higher than the trough level reached just before the next single dose.
The consensus panel recommends that a maintenance dosage of methadone not be predetermined or limited by policy if that policy does not allow adjustments for individual patients. 
Other common dosing issues
Signs and symptoms associated with lesser degrees of withdrawal and acute opioid overdose are well known, but patient changes associated with overmedicating and undermedicating are less dramatic and often more subjective. 
Certain medical factors may cause a patientís dosage requirements to change, including (but not limited to) starting, stopping, or changing the dosage of other prescription medications; onset and progression of pregnancy; onset of menopause; progression of liver disease; significant increase or decrease in weight; or aging (elderly patients are sometimes more sensitive to drugs such as opioids). Patient complaints of opioid craving, withdrawal symptoms, medication side effects, or intoxication always should be investigated and never should be dismissed.
Overmedication. Mildly to moderately overmedicated patients might show ìnoddingî and closing of the eyes or might fall asleep at inappropriate times. These patients might scratch their faces continuously, especially their noses. In some cases, sedation might occur but be unapparent, and some overmedicated patients might feel mildly stimulated. Nausea also can occur, particularly in newer patients. Patients should be told when overmedication is suspected, and their dosage should be reduced. Patients also might report feeling high or ìloadedî and ask for a reduced dosage. Such a reduction can be helpful for patients committed to abstinence rather than ongoing medication maintenance because they may find physical reminders of intoxication discouraging, frightening, or relapse triggering.
Vomited doses. Patients who report that they have vomited their medication pose special problems. The consensus panel recommends that only doses lost to witnessed emesis be replaced. Emesis 30 minutes after dosing can be handled by reassuring patients that the full dose has been absorbed. Emesis at 15 to 30 minutes after dosing can be handled by replacing half the dose, and the whole dose should be replaced if emesis occurs within 15 minutes of dosing. If vomiting persists, it is important to remember that only a portion of the gut is emptied with forceful emesis; therefore, the risk of accumulated toxicity increases with repeated dose replacements. Causes of emesisó including pregnancyóshould be explored.
Ingestion of smaller amounts of medication over a few minutes can be helpful and prudent, as can the occasional use of antiemetic medicines.
“Triggered” withdrawal. Environmental cues, including people, places, things, and feelings associated with drug taking, can be associated strongly with opioid craving and withdrawal. Such reactions may be identical to opioid withdrawal symptoms and can stimulate drug craving and relapse long after opioid use has stopped and physical dependence has been controlled (Self and Nestler 1998). Environmental changes and other stressors can cause patients to perceive that a dose on which they were stabilized is no longer adequate and to experience increased drug craving. Events that increase the availability of substances of abuse, such as another person who uses drugs moving into a patientís home or new sources of illicit drugs, can intensify craving. When their discomfort resumes after a period of abstinence, patients might feel that they are weak willed. They need reassurance that this reaction is a condition of their brain chemistry, not a weakness of will. In animal models, withdrawal symptoms have been conditioned to appear with environmental cues after months of abstinence from opioids (Self and Nestler 1998). The consensus panel believes that increased medication dosages are appropriate in such cases, although efforts also should focus on resolving the troublesome situations such as developing ways to avoid people, places, and things that trigger opioid craving or relapse. Conversely, diminished triggers and reduced drug availability can diminish drug craving and might indicate the possibility of decreasing medication dosage if a patient prefers.
Contingent use of dosage. The consensus panel believes that any manipulation of dosage as either a positive or a negative consequence of behavior is inappropriate and has no place in MAT. The only type of contingency contracting related to medication that should be supported in MAT is that associated with take-home medication. Take-home medication is controlled by Federal regulations, and access is based on several factors, including drug abstinence, OTP attendance, length of time in treatment, and overall functioning. An increase in medication dosage should not be a reward for positive behavior change, although not everyone in the MAT field shares this viewpoint. For example, extensive work has demonstrated the effectiveness of using increased dosage (as well as extra take-home doses) as an incentive to decrease substance abuse and increase treatment program attendance (e.g., Stitzer et al. 1986, 1993; see also Petry 2000). Although the consensus panel acknowledges important behavioral aspects of addiction and the value of contingency management as an aid to behavioral change, using medication dosage as a reward or punishment is considered inappropriate.
Maintenance Pharm acotherapy
The maintenance stage of opioid pharmacotherapy begins when a patient is responding optimally to medication treatment and routine dosage adjustments are no longer needed. Patients at this stage have stopped abusing opioids and other substances and have resumed productive lifestyles away from the people, places, and things associated with their addictions. These patients typically receive scheduled take-home medication privileges. Patients who continue to abuse substances, do not seek employment, or remain connected to their drugusing social networks have not reached this stage. Along with continued observed medication treatment, these latter patients are candidates for intensified counseling and other services to help them reach the maintenance stage.
During the maintenance stage, many patients remain on the same dosage of treatment medication for many months, whereas others require frequent or occasional adjustments. Periods of increased stress, strenuous physical labor, negative environmental factors, greater drug availability, pregnancy, or increased drug hunger can reawaken the need for increased dosages over short or extended periods. Serious emotional crises may require long-term or temporary dosage adjustments. Although the counseling relationship and patient interview are paramount, drug test reports and medication blood levels are useful for dosage determination and adjustment during and after transition from stabilization to the maintenance stage.
Medically Supervised Withdraw al
When stable patients in the maintenance stage ask for dosage reductions, it is important to explore their reasons. They might believe that they can get by on less medication, or they might be responding to external pressures. Patients often perceive that those on lower dosages are ìbetter patients.î These situations require physicians or other staff members to educate patients and their significant others about the importance of adequate dosage and how individual differences in absorption, body weight, metabolism, and tolerance can affect the dosage necessary to achieve stability (Leavitt et al. 2000).
Voluntary Tapering and Dosag e Reduction
For various reasons, some patients attempt reduction or cessation of maintenance medication. Some studies indicate high relapse rates, often 80 percent or more, for this group, including patients judged to be rehabilitated before tapering (e.g., Magura and Rosenblum 2001). However, the likelihood of successful dose tapering also depends on individual factors such as motivation and family support. The possibility of relapse should be explained to patients who want to dose taper, especially those who are not stable on their current dosage, as part of the informed-consent process. Patients who choose tapering should be monitored closely and taught relapse prevention strategies. They and their families should be aware of risk factors for relapse during and after tapering. If relapse occurs or is likely, additional therapeutic measures can be taken, including rapid resumption of MAT when appropriate (American Society of Addiction Medicine 1997).
Ideally, withdrawal should be attempted when it is desired strongly by a stable patient who has a record of abstinence and has adjusted positively on MAT. However, sometimes dose tapering is necessary for administrative reasons, such as a response to extreme antisocial behavior, noncompliance with minimal program standards, or a move to a location where MAT is unavailable. In such cases, providers should refer patients to other programs that are more reasonable and practical in terms of the patientsí overall situation (e.g., motivation, resource availability, ability to pay).
In a review of research on withdrawal from MAT, Magura and Rosenblum (2001) noted that many treatment providers lacked effective ways to improve outcomes for patients who undertook planned withdrawal and that opioid craving remained prevalent in this group, even after successful physiological withdrawal. They concluded, therefore, that planned withdrawal from opioid pharmacotherapy should be undertaken conservatively.
Relapse prevention techniques should be incorporated into counseling and other support services both before and during dosage reduction. Such structured techniques can be useful safeguards in preventing and preparing for relapse. Use of mutual-help techniques (see chapter 8) is recommended highly, especially during dosage reduction.
Although most data about outcomes after tapering from opioid medication come from studies of methadone maintenance, the consensus panel believes that success rates are likely to be similar for patients who taper from buprenorphine or LAAM, and similar cautions and monitoring processes should be in place.
Methadone dosage reduction
The techniques and rates of graded methadone reduction vary widely among patients. One common practice is to reduce daily doses in roughly 5- to 10-percent increments with 1 to 2 weeks between reductions, adjusting as needed for patient conditions. Because reductions become smaller but intervals remain about the same, many months may be spent in such graded reductions. The rate of withdrawal can be increased or decreased based on individual patient response. A slow withdrawal gives patients and staff time to stop the tapering or resume maintenance if tapering is not working and relapse seems likely.
Regardless of the rate of withdrawal from methadone, a point usually is reached at which steady-state occupancy of opiate receptors is no longer complete and discomfort, often with drug hunger and craving, emerges. This point may occur at any dosage but is more common with methadone when the dosage is below 40 mg per day. Highly motivated patients with good support systems can continue withdrawal despite these symptoms. Some patients appear to have specific thresholds at which further dosage reductions become difficult.
Physicians and other staff members should be alert to the possibility of patients attempting dose tapering by substituting other psychoactive substances, such as alcohol, cocaine, sedatives-hypnotics, or other nonopioid substances for their maintenance medication.
Some patients might request blind dosage reduction, that is, withdrawal from medication without their awareness of dose reductions at each step. Blind dosage reduction is appropriate only if requested by a patient. It should be discussed and agreed on before it is implemented. It is inappropriate, clinically and ethically, to withdraw a patient from maintenance medication without his or her knowledge and consent. The consensus panel recommends that OTP staff always disclose dosing information unless patients have given specific informed consent and have requested that providers not tell them their exact dosages.
Withdrawal and termination from LA A M maintenance
Patients who choose tapering
should be moni-
tored closely and
taught relapse prevention strategies.
Few studies have addressed medically supervised withdrawal from LAAM. Because LAAM is longer acting than methadone, withdrawal should be expected to have a delayed onset and protracted course, although symptoms might be less intense than with other opioids. Patients tend to dislike longer periods of withdrawal, regardless of symptom intensity. Special counseling might be needed to address this aspect of withdrawal from LAAM.
For patients on LAAM who wish to be medication free, dosage can be reduced gradually at a rate determined by their response. Patients who prefer less protracted withdrawal can be converted to and then tapered from methadone. As with tapering from methadone (Moolchan and Hoffman 1994), tapering from LAAM should take into account a patientís level of stability, past functioning without medication, and fear of withdrawal.
Medically Supervised Withdraw al After Detoxification
For patients who neither qualify for nor desire opioid maintenance treatment, methadone or buprenorphine may be used to control withdrawal from illicit opioids or from abuse of prescription opioids (detoxification) and then can be tapered gradually (medically supervised withdrawal). Regulations specify two kinds of detoxification with methadone: short-term treatment of less than 30 days and long-term treatment of 30 to 180 days. These regulations specify that patients who fail two detoxification attempts in 12 months must be evaluated for a different treatment (42 CFR, Part 8 ß 12(e)(4)). 
Dosing decisions in medically supervised withdrawal are related to the intended steepness of tapering. Patients undergoing short-term withdrawal may never achieve steady state, and tapering from methadone may be too steep if it begins at a dose greater than about 40 mg. In long-term withdrawal, stabilization of dosage at a therapeutic range is followed by more gradual reduction (see Exhibit 5-7).
Involuntary Tapering or Dosag e Reduction
When patients violate program rules or no longer meet treatment criteria, involuntary tapering might be indicated although it should be avoided if possible (see chapter 8). For example, if many days of dosing are missed and repeated attempts to help a patient comply with daily dosing requirements have failed, maintenance pharmacotherapy no longer may be possible. Treatment decisions should be made in the patientís best interest. If patient progress is unsatisfactory at a particular level of care, the physician should explore the possibility of increasing that patientís care while maintaining him or her on methadone. Involuntary tapering and discontinuation of maintenance medication may be necessary if a patient is unwilling to comply with treatment or tapering or discontinuation of medication appears to be in the patientís best interest.
If a patient is intoxicated repeatedly with alcohol or sedative drugs, the addition of an opioid medication is unsafe, and any dose should be withheld, reduced, or tapered. Disruptive or violent behavior or threats to staff and other patients might be reasons for dismissal without 
tapering or for immediate transfer to another facility where a patient may be treated under safer conditions.
Administrative tapering for nonpayment of fees may be part of the structure to which patients agree on admission. It should be noted that, in addiction treatment, a patientís sudden lack of funds is a marker of possible relapse.
LA A M
When involuntary withdrawal from LAAM is unavoidable, patients can be transferred to methadone before withdrawal because clinical experience with methadone withdrawal is more extensive.
Incarceration
When patients know that they must serve time in jail or prison, planned withdrawal is the best course of action. At this writing, few correctional institutions offer methadone maintenance to nonpregnant inmates (National Drug Court Institute 2002). Many jails do not provide methadone for detoxification. When a patient in MAT is arrested, program staff should make every effort to communicate with the criminal justice authorities involved and to recommend that the patient be withdrawn gradually from medication. Regardless of which opioid medication is used, maintenance or medically supervised withdrawal is preferable to sudden discontinuation of the medication. The consensus panel recommends that opioid pharmacotherapy be made available during incarceration for patients who are already in MAT when incarcerated.
Take-Hom e Medications
Take-home medication refers to unsupervised doses. Any OTP patient may receive a single take-home dose for a day when the OTP is closed for business, including Sundays and State and Federal holidays. Beyond this, decisions on dispensing take-home medication are determined by the medical director in accordance with eight criteria for take-home medication specified in Federal regulations (42 CFR, Part 8 ß 12(i)): 
1.	Absence of recent drug and alcohol abuse
2.	Regular OTP attendance
3.	Absence of behavioral problems at the OTP
4.	Absence of recent criminal activity
5.	Stable home environment and social relationships
6.	Acceptable length of time in comprehensivemaintenance treatment
7.	Assurance of safe storage of take-home medication
8.	Determination that rehabilitative benefits ofdecreased OTP attendance outweigh the potential risk of diversion.
Once these clinical criteria are met, maximum take-home doses must be further restricted based on length of time in treatment as follows:
ï First 90 days (months 1 through 3): one take-home dose per week
ï Second 90 days (months 4 through 6): two take-home doses per week
ï Third 90 days (months 7 through 9): three take-home doses per week
ï Fourth 90 days (months 10 through 12): 6 daysí supply of take-home doses per week
ï After 1 year of continuous treatment: 2 weeksí supply of take-home medication 
ï After 2 years of continuous treatment: 1 monthís supply of take-home medication, but monthly OTP visits are still required. 
Additional restrictions are imposed in some States. No take-home doses are permitted for patients in short-term detoxification or interim maintenance treatment.
Specific Clinical Considerations in Take-Hom e Status Demands of a concurrent medical disorder
The existence and severity of a concurrent medical disorder (see chapter 10) are additional considerations in determining whether takehome medication is appropriate. For patients with concurrent diseases causing impaired ambulation, reduced OTP attendance might be required to aid recovery and prevent complications. In these cases, OTPs should consider seeking medical exceptions for patients who would not otherwise be permitted to receive take-home doses of medication. These patient exceptions should be requested on Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) form 
SMA-168, Exception Request and Record of Justification. Form SMA-168 is available at dpt.samhsa.gov/Exception168Final.htm.
No take-home doses are 
permitted for
patients in 
short-term detoxification or interim maintenance treatment.
When a new medication treatmentósuch as rifampin, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), or phenytoinóthat is known to interact with an opioid treatment medication is introduced, a MAT patient might need a dosage adjustment (see chapter 3 for further discussion of medications that interact with opioid treatment medications). Take-home medication should be avoided until a patient is stable on these new medica-
tions and the risks of an undesirable outcome have diminished. In these instances, more frequent observations are important to monitor concurrent disease, to avoid methadone-related complications of a concurrent medical disorder, and to ensure that the pharmacological benefits of administering methadone are maintained during the course and treatment of the concurrent disease.
Enhancement of rehabilitative potential
Another important issue in take-home medication involves reviewing whether it is likely to help rehabilitate a patient. Take-home medication may enable patients to engage in employment, education, childcare, or other important endeavors.
Emergency circumstances
During emergency situations or unforeseen circumstances such as personal or family crises; bereavement; or medical, family, or employment hardships, the need may arise for unscheduled take-home medication. An OTP can facilitate emergency or hardship access to medication for a patient by submitting SAMHSA form SMA-168. The OTPís policies should explain who can request exceptions and how it is done. Courtesy dosing at a distant OTP usually can be arranged if unstabilized patients are traveling.
Positive drug tests, diversion control, and take-home medications
The consensus panel believes that take-home medications are inadvisable for patients who continue to abuse illicit drugs or misuse prescription medications, as evidenced by drug testing or other assessment information, and for those whose drug tests do not reflect medication ingestion. Under the disinhibiting effects of other substances, patients might be unable to safeguard or adequately store their takehome doses. They should be encouraged to keep their medication in a locked cabinet away from food or other medicines and out of the reach of children. Some programs require patients to bring a locked container to the OTP when they pick up their take-home medication to hold it while in transit. This policy should be considered carefully because most such containers are large and visible, which might serve more to advertise that a patient is carrying medication than to promote safety. 
Methadone is stable and does not need refrigeration when in diskette or tablet form. However, when methadone diskettes are reconstituted or liquid methadone oral concentrate is used and diluted with juice or some other sugar-based liquid, the mixture may not remain stable beyond a few days without refrigeration. Manufacturer instructions call for adding a minimum of 30 mL or 1 fluid ounce of liquid per dose when reconstituting methadone. 
Although methadone has a significant street value, a National Institutes of Health consensus statement refers to it as ìa medication that is not often diverted to individuals for recreational or casual use but rather to individuals with opiate dependence who lack access to [methadone maintenance treatment] programsî (National Institutes of Health 1997b, p. 20). Nevertheless, reported deaths attributed to methadone have increased significantly in some States. According to data from the Drug Abuse Warning Network, more than 10,000 emergency room visits related to methadone were reported in 2001 compared with more than 5,000 in 1999 (Crane 2003). This increase has occurred in the context of overall increases in abuse of prescription opioids, in particular hydrocodone and oxycodone. Local reports indicate that most diverted methadone comes from medical prescriptions because it has gained acceptance as an excellent chronic pain treatment (Belluck 2003). Although the slow onset of methadone makes it less attractive than prescription opioids to potential abusers, it also makes methadone more dangerous because respiratory depression can become significant hours after ingestion. To guard against the possibility of methadone-related respiratory depression, the consensus panel recommends the following diversion control policies for take-home medication:
ï Require patients to return all empty dose bottles on their next OTP visit after takehome dosing. Staff members who accept these bottles should inspect them to ensure that they are coming from the indicated patient during the appropriate period.
ï Institute procedures for responding to
patients who frequently fail to return or have unverified reasons for failing to return empty take-home bottles. Staff should consider discontinuing take-home medication for these patients. 
ï Stay open 7 days a week for dispensing. In this way, take-home doses can be provided only to stable patients with a record of adherence to treatment, rather than to all patients regardless of their status with the program.
Behavior, social stability, and take-home medications
Patients appearing intoxicated; demonstrating aggressive, seriously impaired, or disordered behavior; or engaging in ongoing criminal behavior are poor candidates for take-home medication. Their home environments also are keys to the safety and storage of medication. Where social relationships are unstable, a significant risk exists that methadone takehome doses will be secured inadequately from diversion or accidental use (e.g., by children). If patients with take-home privileges develop altered mental competency, such as in dementia, frequent loss of consciousness, or delusional states, then take-home privileges should be reevaluated.
Monitoring Patients Who Receive Take-Hom e Medications
Monitoring should ensure that patients with take-home medication privileges are free of illicit drug use and consume their medication as directed. This goal can be met through random drug testing and periodic interdisciplinary assessment of continuing eligibility. OTPs should consider carefully whether to use pill counts or callbacks of dispensed take-home doses to verify adherence to program rules. In a pill count or callback, the patient receives an unannounced phone call and must show up at the OTP within a reasonable period (e.g., 24 to 36 hours) with all MAT medications. The number of pills remaining must correspond to the number expected based on prescribed ingestion. A physician should review periodically the status of every patient provided with take-home medication. When these strategies are followed, programs should state their policies clearly to patients. Callbacks should be used selectively, not be applied across the board, and focus on high-risk patients who have given OTP staff members reason to be concerned.
Issues for review
The rationale for providing take-home medication should be reviewed regularly and documented to determine whether initial justifications continue to apply. For example, if employment was a reason for take-home medication, the patientís continued employment should be verified. If a concurrent medical disorder was the basis, a medical reassessment is necessary to determine whether the clinical status of the concurrent medical disease still warrants reduced OTP attendance.
Reviewing the original rationale for take-home medication is a necessary but insufficient condition for increased patient monitoring. The monitoring process also should include an assessment of whether medical, psychological, or social reasons exist to rescind these privileges.
Treatment interruptions
Many circumstances, such as work-related travel, illness, funerals, planned vacations, and emergencies, might require patients to miss OTP visits. Some unstable patients might miss days because of chaotic social situations. OTPs should have policies to address treatment interruptions.
Disability or illness. When disability or illness prevents patients from coming to the OTP, authorized staff may use home delivery and observed-dosing procedures to ensure treatment continuity. OTPs should evaluate the need for continuity of other support services, as well as medication, in these circumstances.
Hospitalization. OTPs are responsible for ensuring continuity of treatment when patients are hospitalized for medical or psychiatric problems (see chapters 10 and 12). The best practice is for OTP staff to educate and stay in touch with a patientís hospital clinicians about MAT. For example, hospital staff might be unaware that certain drugs, such as partial agonists or mixed agonists and antagonists for pain management, should be avoided for patients receiving LAAM or methadone for opioid addiction (pain management is discussed in chapter 10). It usually is helpful to provide psychiatric consultation to medical or surgical staff members, especially for patients with cooccurring disorders. Written patient consent is necessary for this kind of program-to-hospital communication; however, if a medical emergency poses a threat to a patientís health, the OTP should use the medical emergency exception for treatment when it lacks patient consent. A publication by the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT 2004b) provides a description of the confidentiality regulationsí medical emergency exception.
Hospitalization, particularly of unconscious patients, raises the issue of using identification (ID) cards. Patients can get OTP-specific Medic
Alert ID Cards from Advocates for Recovery Through Medicine (www.methadonetoday.org/ armhelp.htm; telephone 615-354-1320), which can include a patientís name, OTP contact information, and a list of contraindicated medications. Some large urban OTPs provide patients with a photographic ID card to gain admittance to the OTP. Their experience has been that some patients use their OTP cards as generic photographic IDs in lieu of a driverís license; for example, they use them to cash checks, despite the fact that the cards identify them as being in treatment. Smart cards containing a complete medical history are already in use in the United States, Israel, and the Netherlands and may be useful in OTPs. These cards contain electronically encoded information needed to identify and monitor a patient without outwardly identifying the cardholder as a patient.
Missed doses. When doses are missed, it is critical to evaluate patientsí presenting condition. Concerns should include whether a patient has been using illicit drugs or taking other medications, has lost tolerance for previous doses (i.e., whether a previously tolerated dosage is still safe to administer), or is intoxicated.
One dose missed. For patients who miss one scheduled dose and come to the OTP the next dayófor example, 3 to 4 days after the last LAAM or 2 days after the last methadone doseóthe dosage can remain unchanged, and dosing should resume on schedule. For patients on LAAM who miss a dose and come to the OTP 2 days later (i.e., 4 to 5 days after their last LAAM dose), the scheduled dose still is usually well tolerated.
More than 5 days missed. For patients who are out of treatment for a significant time and might have lost tolerance, dosage reduction or reinduction is advisable. Thereafter, increases of 5 to 10 mg per dose up to the previous level can be ordered because it is unlikely that the dosage needed to maintain stability will change in 1 week. Patients might have to be reminded about steady state and that they may not feel back to normal until tissue stores have built up as well.
Office-Based Opioid Therapy
OTPs should consider assisting with transfer arrangements for long-term methadonemaintained patients who prefer to use a physician in the community for ongoing care. Various forms of this treatment have been studied in the United States and found to be safe and efficacious (King et al. 2002; Schwartz et al. 1999).
Patient selection for this treatment option should focus on a history of negative drug tests, a required length of stability in treatment (at least 1 year), social stability, and minimal need for psychosocial services. Methadone can be ordered by private physicians, through an affiliation or other arrangement with an OTP, and patients can obtain their medication at specially registered pharmacies under a SAMHSAapproved protocol. Under this arrangement, patients on extended take-home-dosing schedules (up to 1 month) no longer must ingest their doses under observation. Outcomes have been uniformly positive, with few relapses and little or no diversion reported (King et al. 2002; Schwartz et al. 1999). Patient satisfaction has been found to be significantly better compared with OTP dosing (Fiellin et al. 2001) but not significantly different from a comparable OTP-based monthly medical maintenance and take-home schedule (King et al. 2002).



6 PatientñTreatm ent
Matching : Types of
Services and Levels of Care
In This ChapterÖ
Steps in
PatientñTreatment Matching
Patients With
Special Needs
Treatment Planning
This chapter describes a multidimensional, clinically driven strategy for matching patients in medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction (MAT) with the types of treatment services and levels of care that optimize treatment outcomes, primarily within or in conjunction with opioid treatment programs (OTPs). Level of care refers to the intensity of a treatment (in terms of frequency, type of serviceóindividual, group, familyóand medication) and the type of setting needed for treatment delivery. For information on criteria and methods to determine levels of care in substance abuse treatment, see the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) patient placement criteria (Mee-Lee et al. 2001b). As explained by Mee Lee and colleagues (2001b), the ASAM model conceptualizes opioid pharmacotherapy as a service that can be provided at any level of care, although it is delivered most often in an outpatient setting (i.e., ASAM level I).
The chapter also provides information on developing a treatment plan with short- and long-range goals for each patient. In some cases, patientñtreatment matching and treatment planning involve changes that can move a patient out of comprehensive MAT to a setting that better meets the patientís needs. Because this TIP is primarily about outpatient MAT in OTPs, other settings and programs are discussed only briefly.
In general, patientñtreatment matching involves individualizing, to the extent possible, the choice and application of treatment resources to each patientís needs. The chapter explains recommended elements of a patientñtreatment-matching process, including ways to accommodate special populations with distinct needs and orientations that affect their responses to specific treatments and settings.
Patients enter OTPs at various points along a continuum of substance abuse and addiction. Many also have co-occurring medical and mental health conditions that can be lifelong. Because of the complexity of patientsí circumstances and needs and the range of services required to address these needs, MAT includes not only opioid pharmacotherapy but also other forms of treatment in a comprehensive treatment program

designed to address multiple disorders and needs (see chapter 8).
The consensus panel believes that OTPs not already offering comprehensive MAT services and those lacking resources to adjust levels of care to patient needs either should augment basic opioid pharmacotherapy with services that meet the mental health, medical, and social needs of patients who are opioid addictedóat the level of care each patient needsóor should provide referrals to programs that provide such services.
Steps in
PatientñTreatm ent Matching
Patient Assessm ent
Patientñtreatment matching begins with a thorough assessment to determine each patientís service needs (see chapter 4); then these needs are matched to appropriate levels of care and types of services. Assessment should include the extent, nature, and duration of patientsí opioid and other substance use and their treatment histories, as well as their medical, psychiatric, and psychosocial needs and functional status. A comprehensive assessment should include a patientís gender, culture, ethnicity, language, motivation to comply with treatment, and recovery support outside the OTP.
Type and Intensity of Treatm ent Services Needed Psychosocial treatment services 
In a comprehensive MAT setting, patients often have access to a variety of psychosocial services, including individual, family, and group counseling, as well as case management (see chapter 8). Some programs may provide psychosocial services to patients in other settings. Both residential and outpatient programs may offer intensive individual and group counseling or counseling on a periodic or as-needed basis (De Leon 1994; Margolis and Zweben 1998). Ideally, service intensity should depend on the level of care required to help patients achieve and maintain successful treatment outcomes. Most patients in the acute phase of treatment need to see a counselor daily for counseling or case management, just to become stabilized, whereas others, who may be highly functioning with less severe addiction-related psychosocial problems, require fewer counseling services.
Mutual-help programs 
Although not a form of treatment, mutual-help programs (e.g., 12-Step programs, Secular Organization for Sobriety groups, Women for Sobriety groups) offer effective reinforcement and motivation for individuals during and after discontinuation of active treatment. Such programs provide social support from others who are in recovery from addiction (Washton 1988). Many patients in MAT participate in mutualhelp groups. However, patients with opioid addiction who are maintained on treatment medication can feel out of place in some group settings where continued opioid pharmacotherapy may be misunderstood. Researchers have described a variety of specialized groups and inventive strategies for mutual-help programs that meet the support needs of patients in MAT (Zweben 1991). Chapter 8 presents some of these strategies.
Matching Treatm ent Service Needs to Setting s
After the types and intensities of services that patients need are defined, the next crucial step in patientñtreatment matching is to identify the most appropriate available setting or settings for these services. MAT has been offered primarily in a dedicated outpatient OTP. However, as the importance of treating patientsí varied medical, psychological, social, and behavioral needs as part of addiction recovery has become evident, more varied programs and settings have emerged.
Throughout this TIP, the consensus panel recommends that OTPs lacking the resources to accommodate all their patientsí needs develop cooperative relationships with and refer patients to other treatment providers as appropriate. However, OTPs should coordinate these services. Based on its assessments of patients, the treatment team should collaborate with patients to determine the most appropriate treatment services, intensities of services, and settings needed to meet patient needs. This collaboration should continue throughout MAT, and patient progress should be the basis for adjustments in treatment services and intensities.
Patientsí service needs may change throughout MAT. For example, one patient may need referral to an inpatient program for detoxification from alcohol or benzodiazepines and then return to the OTP setting. Another may need the environment of a residential treatment program while continuing MAT. Therefore, treatment matching in some cases can lead to multiple settings for an individualís treatment. In most cases, the originating OTP should provide case management and liaison for all treatment services.
Types of settings and programs offering opioid addiction treatment services
The following are examples of treatment programs and settings that offer some or all of the comprehensive services recommended in MAT.
Outpatient OTPs. Outpatient OTPs ideally treat patients who are opioid addicted during all phases of treatment and at most levels of care. In reality, many OTPs have capacity or resource limitations or payment requirements that cause them to refer at least some patients to other specialized treatment providers and settings, such as those described below, for services that match patient needs. Either on site or through other care providers, OTPs offer a wide spectrum of treatment services and levels of care for diverse patients.
Appropriate patients for treatment in outpatient OTPs are those who meet Federal and State requirements for opioid addiction treatment (e.g., 42 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 8), those who have done poorly in other types of programs (e.g., medically supervised withdrawal or residential treatment programs), and those who require opioid pharmacotherapy for long-term stabilization.

than freestanding OTPs because access to medical and psychosocial services is readily available. This availability, in turn, increases the likelihood that patients in MAT will engage in and adhere to other medical and psychosocial treatment regimens. 
Hospital-based MAT programs are appropriate for some patients who also are medically ill and require coordinated services or care by special teams. In addition, because hospitals can provide a one-stop-shopping model of care by incorporating some primary care services with MAT, some patients with histories of poor treatment compliance may be more likely to adhere to medical treatment. For example, one report from a 16-month prospective study of nearly 500 persons in a hospitalbased outpatient methadone program found that 81 percent also used onsite primary care services (Selwyn et al. 1993). At this writing, the number of hospital-based programs offering MAT is limited in the United States.
Residential treatment programs. Residential treatment programs offer cooperative living arrangements for patients in recovery, but they vary in their willingness or ability to accept
MAT patients
(Margolis and

Zweben 1998). A residential treatment setting is indicated for patients who require residential placement to support treatment and ensure their physical or psychological safety and who are unlikely to continue MAT otherwise. Such patients generally exhibit high relapse potential, evidenced by an inability to control substance use despite active participation in less intensive outpatient programs (Margolis and Zweben 1998). On completion of treat-
ment in these settings, patients should return to an outpatient setting to continue MAT.
If a patient in an OTP is referred to a residential program that does not offer or allow onsite opioid pharmacotherapy (i.e., when other residential options are unavailable) or methadone or buprenorphine dispensing or administration, some programs allow resident patients to travel to the OTP for medication. Some States allow exceptions to regulations governing OTP attendance and take-home medications so that concurrent treatment is possible. 
Mobile treatment units. The success of mobile treatment unitsóthat is, mobile vansóin such cities as Baltimore, Boston, San Francisco, and Seattle (Greenfield et al. 1996; Schmoke 1995) highlights the importance of program accessibility as a factor affecting length of stay in treatment and positive treatment outcomes (Greenfield et al. 1996). Mobile substance abuse treatment programs either offer comprehensive maintenance services (with medication, collection of samples for drug testing, and counseling provided in one or several mobile units) or work in conjunction with fixed-site outpatient programs that offer medical care and counseling and other psychosocial services, while medication is delivered via the mobile units. 
Appropriate patients for treatment in mobile treatment units are those in locations where fixed-site programs are unavailable, those with ambulatory disabilities, and those initially stabilized in an OTP and then transferred to a mobile unit for continued treatment. Mobile units not staffed on weekends are appropriate only for patients who meet State and Federal regulations for weekend take-home medications.
Office-based opioid treatment settings. After achieving biomedical and psychosocial stabilization in an OTP, some patients might be eligible for referral to less intensive physicianís office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) for medical maintenance. In these settings, patients receive the same level of monitoring and intervention as patients receiving other types of health care. When available, OBOT programs offer several advantages (Fiellin and OíConnor
2002), including
ï Less intensive service requirements for stable patients (e.g., less restrictive environments, focus on maintenance with stable doses of opioid medication, provision of only those psychosocial services needed to prevent relapse)
ï Minimized stigma associated with addiction treatment
ï Increased opportunity for new treatment admissions to OTPs
ï Expansion of treatment to geographic areas where there are no OTPs or there are waiting lists for admission to OTPs.
Criminal justice settings. At this writing, relatively few jails or prisons offer comprehensive MAT or selected MAT services, but these numbers are likely to increase (for information about substance abuse treatment in criminal justice settings, see TIP 44, Substance Abuse Treatment for Adults in the Criminal Justice System [CSAT 2005a]). As a result, MAT services are often interrupted or discontinued when patients are incarcerated. Rikers Island, New York Cityís central jail facility, is an example of a model program that provides comprehensive MAT for this patient group (Magura et al. 1993). Patients who receive MAT there are guaranteed a slot at a community-based program in New York City after their incarceration. Other corrections facilities provide rapid medically supervised withdrawal from maintenance medication to patients. When this withdrawal is the only option, OTPs should work with criminal justice institutions to ensure that appropriate dose-tapering procedures are followed. Patients released from a criminal justice setting should be offered referral to an OTP when referral is desirable and feasible.
Other treatment settings. Numerous other settings and specialized programs offer some services and levels of care needed by patients who are opioid addicted. Any of these programs can be sources of referral by OTPs or can function as satellite OTPs to ensure that patients receive services and levels of care they need.
Choice of Medications
The consensus panel recommends that OTPs offer a variety of treatment medications. Chapters 3 and 5 provide more details about the pharmacology and appropriate use of methadone, levo-alpha acetyl methadol, buprenorphine, and naltrexone.
Patients With Special Needs
Effective treatment for opioid addiction should address the unique needs of each patient (OíConnor and Fiellin 2000; Rowan-Szal et al. 2000a). Culturally competent and creative treatment planning, implementation, and referrals should address the distinct needs of patients from different backgrounds. More staff training and research are required on the unique constellations of treatment needs for various populations served by OTPs. Findings for particular groups are summarized below. Other treatment groupings may be identified, for example, high-profile persons for whom unique treatment schedules and settings may be needed to protect confidentiality (CSAT forthcoming e).
Patients With Serious Medical Disorders
If a serious medical condition is discovered during medical evaluation or patient assessment, the patient should receive appropriate medical treatment either on site or by referral to a medical center. Chapter 10 describes medical conditions commonly encountered among patients in MAT and provides treatment recommendations. Most OTPs offer only basic medical services. OTPs should develop and maintain referral networks for patients who present for MAT and have other medical conditions. Moreover, OTP staff should coordinate referrals and follow up as needed to ensure compliance with medical treatments and to act as consultants about MAT and medication interactions.
Patients With Serious Co-Occurring Disorders
Many studies have focused on the cooccurrence of substance use and mental disorders (see chapter 12). The existence of co-occurring disorders should not prevent patientsí admission to an OTP; however, diagnosis of these disorders is critical to match patients with appropriate services and settings. Therefore, OTPs should include professional staff trained to screen for the presence of cooccurring disorders, develop appropriate referrals to services (e.g., psychopharmacology or psychotherapy) for these disorders, and provide coordination of care (CSAT 2005b). Most staff members can be trained to recognize and flag major symptoms of co-occurring disorders. The OTP should maintain communication and followup with referral resources.
Patients With Housing , Fam ily, or Social Problem s
The following psychosocial problems should be addressed during or directly after admission to increase the likelihood that patients will engage successfully in treatment:
ï Lack of stable housing ï Broken ties with family members; nonexistent or dysfunctional family relationships
ï Poor social skills and lack of a supportive social network
ï Unemployment; lack of employable skills.
Once these needs are identified during assessment, referrals can be made. Although some OTPs have social workers on site to manage the assessment and referral processes, most OTPs rely on counselors to assume this role. Case management duties should include arrangements for provision of psychosocial care when indicated. Family members need education about MAT, including information on how to support a partner or loved one in recovery, self-care of family members, signs and symptoms of active addiction, and support and assistance from family members willing to participate in family counseling. Programs can offer monthly classes to patients, their families, and the community, which can reduce the stigma connected with MAT.
Patients With Disabilities
OTPs should try to provide access for patients with physical disabilities. Treatment interventions for these patients usually include vocational rehabilitation, physical therapy, and social services that help procure prosthetic limbs, wheelchairs, and other assistive devices (CSAT 1998c). Alternative approaches in MAT, specifically those that reduce OTP visits, include take-home dosing and requests for medical exceptions through visiting-nurse services to provide equal access to treatment for persons with disabilities (see chapter 10).
Mobile medication units and office-based or home-nursing services may offer viable treatment options for patients with disabilities (Fiellin and OíConnor 2002; Greenfield et al. 1996). OTP staff should address these challenges with patients so that barriers to treatment are overcome.
The consensus panel recommends that OTPs engage in discussions with their Federal and State agencies to develop solutions for treating patients with disabilities. Such discussions should balance the medical needs of these patients and the safety issues involved in providing take-home medications for patients with disabilities who continue to engage in substance abuse or create a risk of medication diversion.
Adolescents and Young Adults
Adolescents and young adults present a unique challenge for MAT. Often, ethnic background, peer affiliations, and aspects of the ìyouth cultureî require staff training and special expectations from both staff and patients. Differences in routes of administration for heroin or prescription opioids and in treatment needs between adolescents or young adults and older adults who are opioid addicted might be attributable in part to generational characteristics and life experiences. For example, older adults typically present for treatment after years (sometimes decades) of chronic substance abuse accompanied by loss of family, health, and employment and deterioration in other psychosocial domains. Youth who are opioid addicted tend to present after only a few years of addiction and with different attitudes toward addiction and the recovery process and distinct treatment needs. These youth may be more difficult to evaluate, because, as a result of other modes of administration (i.e., intranasally and by smoking), they do not exhibit some physical markers of opioid use (e.g., track marks).
Treatment for adolescents and young adults should integrate knowledge of their specific developmental and psychosocial concerns and needs. Some needs are related to identity formation and peer group preoccupation (e.g., the strong desire to be viewed as fearless or to feel invincible), legal complications regarding consent for treatment (see CSAT 2004b), and, often, factors leading them to run away from their homes. TIP 32, Treatment of Adolescents With Substance Use Disorders (CSAT 1999d), provides background information.
Other risk factors for this group include possible sexual and physical abuse, young age at first sexual experience, incidents of trading sex for drugs (Astemborski et al. 1994; Fullilove et al. 1990), and co-occurring disorders (Fuller et al. 2002; Hawkins et al. 1992). These risk factors also can contribute to increased risk for HIV infection (Doherty et al. 2000; Fuller et al. 2001) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).
The interaction of developmental and psychosocial factors affects the ability of adolescents and young adults to engage in MAT and therefore complicates the recovery process. OTPs should provide psychosocial services that address the unique needs of this age group, especially those needs that affect their substance use and recovery, or they should establish referrals and links to youth-oriented psychosocial counseling services.
Buprenorphine may be a particularly satisfactory treatment for some adolescents. Because buprenorphine can be administered in an OBOT setting, it should become more widely available and offer more privacy and less stigma for young patients (see CSAT 2004a).
Wom en Pregnancy
The special needs of women who are opioid addicted and pregnant should be assessed thoroughly through a comprehensive medical evaluation, as discussed in chapter 13. Treatment matching for pregnant patients in MAT should provide optimal, comprehensive, and intensive services related to pregnancy and birth including prenatal care, maternal nutrition, and psychosocial rehabilitation, along with MAT. The integration of a womenís overall health initiative into MAT improves an OTPís capacity to meet the special needs of these patients, to address potential biomedical and obstetrical complications, and to avoid adverse effects of substance use on the fetus (Finnegan and Kandall 1992). Chapter 13 offers a detailed overview of MAT for pregnant women (also see CSAT forthcoming f).
Case management
...should include arrangements for... psychosocial care when indicated.
OTPs are required by regulation or accreditation standards to test for pregnancy, but the provision of prenatal care and ancillary services for pregnant women varies depending on the treatment setting. Hospital-based programs may be better suited for pregnant women in some cases because hospitals offer easy access to referrals and links to specialty care (on or off site).
Sexual or physical abuse
Patientsí risks of ongoing abuse in their current relationships should be addressed, and appropriate plans or referrals made. Cooccurring disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder can occur among both women and men who have experienced sexual or physical abuse. The best treatment settings to address womenís needs in these cases include OTPs with onsite care provided by psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed social workers, or mental health professionals with special training in this area. In lieu of onsite services, OTPs should establish referral links to programs offering such services. Many social service agencies, as well as agencies responsible for domestic violence, offer training and support to OTP staff. TIP 36, Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons With Child Abuse and Neglect
Issues (CSAT 2000d), provides further details.
Complex medical problems
The complex medical problems commonly diagnosed in women in MAT include gynecological infections, amenorrhea, hypertension, and pneumonia (Brown et al. 1992). It is optimal to provide primary care services on site; hospitalbased programs and OTPs with formalized medical referral systems are best equipped to deliver such services. Chapter 10 of this TIP and the forthcoming TIP Substance Abuse Treatment: Addressing the Specific Needs of Women (CSAT forthcoming f) provide additional information.
Parents
Most patients can be maintained on their MAT dosage while 
taking short-acting opioids for pain relief...
Because many patients in MAT are parents, the lack of adequate childcare services is often a barrier to OTP attendance and successful treatment. One solution is supervised onsite childcare services, which also may provide opportunities to observe how patients relate to their children. Problems in parenting skills can be addressed in treatment planning and through parenting groups for patients with children. However, onsite childcare services are available in few programs because of limited resources and licensing and insurance requirements. These obstacles might
cause missed appointments or lack of privacy and concentration for parents who must bring their children to treatment and counseling sessions. Insufficient treatment may result.
The consensus panel recommends that OTPs seek opportunities and funding for onsite childcare where appropriate and feasible to help patients with children engage successfully in psychosocial services. Where childcare is unavailable, program staff should offer referrals to community daycare agencies.
In most States, OTPs are mandated reporters of child abuse and neglect. When children are at imminent risk of harm or appear neglected, OTPs are required to notify local childrenís protective services (CPS) agencies so that an investigation can be conducted. This requirement can create conflict between an OTP and a patient, and the OTP should try to address this issue in a supportive way. Programs and treatment providers should not discriminate against patients because they have entered into pretreatment agreements or have difficulties with CPS agencies (see chapter 13).
Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Patients
Just as important as sensitivity to cultural differences based on race or ethnicity is providing a treatment climate that is available and sensitive to lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) patients by openly acknowledging their heterogeneity and variations in sexual orientation and treating these individuals with dignity and respect (CSAT 2001b; Lombardi and van Servellen
2000). OTP staff should be prepared to assist LGB patients in coping with problems related to their sexual orientation and the need for HIV/AIDS and STD risk avoidance. Providers should help patients obtain appropriate medical care and secure their safety if, for example, they are threatened. OTPs also should acknowledge the unique social support structures of LGB patients, which can provide a way to counteract isolation and separation from community, peers, and immediate and extended family members (Hughes and Eliason 2002; also see CSAT 2001b). Finally, the consensus panel recommends that OTPs identify and refer LGB patients to community counseling, support, and spiritual and religious organizations that are sensitive to these groups and address any sexual- or gender-orientation concerns these patients have that could affect treatment.
Ag ing Patients
MAT treatment planners should consider the stressors common to the aging patient, such as loss of family, retirement, loneliness, and boredom, which can contribute to high risk of selfovermedication and addiction to alcohol and medications. The consensus panel recommends that OTPs focus on the following areas when working with elderly patients:
ï Monitoring the increased risk for dangerous drug interactions; elderly patients often are prescribed multiple medications.
ï Differentiating between co-occurring disorders and symptoms and disorders associated with aging (including dementia) (Lawson 1989).
ï Differentiating between depression and dementia.
ï Screening for and treating physical and sexual abuse (see chapter 4).
ï Developing referral sources that meet the needs of elderly patients. Relationships with skilled nursing facilities and nursing homes are particularly important (Lawson 1989).
ï Training staff to be sensitive to the elderly patient population.
ï Providing psychosocial treatment for ageassociated stressors and medical screening and referral for common medical conditions affected by the aging process (see CSAT 1998b).
ï Assessing and adjusting dosage levels of medication for the slowed metabolism of many elderly patients.
Patients With Pain
Patients in MAT often are undertreated or denied medication for acute or chronic pain management (Compton and Athanasos 2003). Health care workers may misperceive pain medication requests by patients in MAT as drug-seeking behavior, in part because of patientsí higher tolerance for opioids and, usually, their need for higher doses. Many physicians who treat pain do not have the necessary education to treat pain in this population (Prater et al. 2002). MAT providers should evaluate patient treatment needs for pain management and assist patients directly in obtaining optimal pain treatment. Medical providers in MAT should work collaboratively with primary care providers and pain and palliative-care clinicians to ensure establishment of appropriate pain interventions for patients in MAT. Providers need education about maintaining current opioid levels while adding sufficient immediate-release treatment agents to manage acute or chronic pain. More frequent dosing and short-term increased demand for pain treatment medication should be expected. Referrals to specialty pain clinics often provide patients a full spectrum of pain care, including pharmacological and psychological or behavioral treatments to alleviate pain symptoms. These services most often are accessible through hospital-based programs or referral linkages. Most patients can be maintained on their MAT dosage while taking short-acting opioids for pain relief; however, individualized pain treatment is usually necessary.
Treatm ent Planning
After patientsí individual needs are assessed and the best available treatment services and most appropriate levels of care are determined, a treatment plan should be developed with the patient, as required by accreditation guidelines (CSAT 1999b).
Developing a Treatm ent Plan
Treatment planning for MAT should involve a multidisciplinary team, including physicians, counselors, nurses, case managers, social workers, and patients. Based on a thorough patient history and assessment, a treatment plan should be realistic and tailored to each patientís needs, strengths, goals, and objectives. Good treatment plans contain both shortand long-term goals and specify the actions needed to reach each goal. Treatment plans should indicate which goals and objectives require referral to and followup with outside resources and which are provided by the OTP itself. Treatment plans should contain specific, measurable treatment objectives that can be evaluated for degree of accomplishment.
Role of the counselor in plan formulation
Counselors should ensure that treatment plans incorporate strategies to develop therapeutic relationships with patients, based on respect for patientsí autonomy and dignity, while motivating patients to become willing partners in the change process (CSAT 1999a). This role, which places great responsibility on the counselor, usually incorporates cognitive behavioral approaches in which providers strive to enhance patient motivation for change by focusing on patient strengths and respecting patient decisions (CSAT 1999a). To engage patients in the process of treatment planning, counselors should encourage the inclusion of motivational enhancement strategies that highlight appropriate, realistic treatment goals (Di Clemente 1991). Research has shown that confrontational counseling or the use of negative contingencies often predicts treatment failure (Miller and Rollnick 2002). 
Role of the patient in plan formulation
A patient in MAT should be an integral member of the treatment team with his or her needs and expectations considered respectfully and incorporated into the treatment plan. Patients who agree with the treatment rationale or therapeutic approach tend to experience increased determination to improve (Hubble et al. 1999). A patientís participation in treatment planning can enhance motivation to adhere to change strategies, leading to positive treatment outcomes such as higher rates of abstinence and better social adjustment (CSAT 1999a). When possible, the treatment plan should be written in a patientís own words to describe his or her unique strengths, needs, abilities, and preferences as well as his or her challenges and problems. The plan also should contain mutually approved goals that reflect awareness of and sensitivity to a patientís informed choices, cultural background, age, and medical status or disability. 
Other factors in plan formulation
Treatment plans should incorporate an assessment of linguistic and cultural factors that might affect treatment and recovery either positively or negatively (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2001). Treatment providers should work collaboratively with patients to identify health-related cultural beliefs, values, and practices and to decide how to address these factors in the treatment plan (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2001).
Motivation for treatment
Patient motivational strategies should be incorporated throughout the treatment plan. As part of this process, the treatment team can benefit from an understanding of stages of change and their effects on patient progress. Prochaska and colleagues (1982, 1986, 1992), who formulated a useful model that explains how people change, observed five stages of readiness for change during addiction treatment: contemplation, determination, action, maintenance, and relapse. An earlier stage (precontemplation) also plays a role. Patients and treatment providers ideally should develop recommended treatment options in the plan based on each patientís readiness for treatment, which can be determined by identifying the patientís stage-ofchange readiness. The stages-of-change model and corresponding counseling responsibilities are described in TIP 35, Enhancing Motivation for Change in Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT 1999a).
Elem ents of a Treatm ent Plan
Because some patients require assistance in many functional areas, treatment plans should address measurable, achievable goals relevant to the patientís current situation. Short-term goals, such as vocational rehabilitation assessment or computer training, can evolve from a long-term goal, such as full-time employment. However, treatment plans should be simple and not so comprehensive that they overpower a patient with the tasks that must be achieved. Although both short- and long-term goals should be considered, the patientís involvement in defining measurable, achievable goals is important. Treatment plans should be modified periodically when progress can be assessed. Most OTPs have forms to use for treatment planning, many of which were developed to meet regulatory and accreditation requirements, specifying goals, actions, responsible parties, and measurable outcomes. The panel urges that these forms not be overly complex or overwhelming to the patient. Patients should receive a copy of the plan. Exhibit 6-1 provides a case study and an example of a treatment plan.
